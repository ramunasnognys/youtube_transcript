This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.
Generated by Repopack on: 2024-10-31T15:05:42.596Z

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repopack's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

[00:00] welcome back
[00:02] here we go again great to see you and
[00:03] congratulations thank you um you will
[00:06] never forget what is going on in the
[00:08] world when you think about when your
[00:10] child is born you will know for the rest
[00:12] of this child&#39;s life you were born
[00:14] during a weird time that&#39;s for sure
[00:17] that is for sure
[00:19] they&#39;re probably the weirdest that i can
[00:20] remember
[00:21] uh yeah yeah um and he was born on uh
[00:24] may the fourth and yeah that&#39;s hilarious
[00:26] too yeah may the fourth be with him yeah
[00:29] exactly it has to be hopefully i sure
[00:30] hope so perfect yes i mean that was the
[00:32] perfect day for you
[00:34] and
[00:35] how do you say the name
[00:38] well uh is it a placeholder first of all
[00:41] my partner is the one that actually
[00:43] mostly came up with the name
[00:44] congratulations to her yeah yeah she&#39;s
[00:46] great at names um so
[00:49] i mean it&#39;s just
[00:50] x the letter x
[00:52] um and then
[00:54] the ae is like pronounced ash
[00:59] yeah
[01:00] and then
[01:01] a12 a12 is my contribution
[01:04] oh why a12 uh archangel 12 the precursor
[01:07] to the sr-71 coolest plane ever
[01:12] that&#39;s true i i agree with you i don&#39;t
[01:14] know i&#39;m not familiar with it i know
[01:15] what the sr-71 is yeah yeah yeah i know
[01:17] what that is so the sr71 came from a cia
[01:20] program uh
[01:21] called archangel oh it&#39;s the archangel
[01:23] project
[01:24] and then archangel 12. oh wow what a
[01:26] dope-looking plane yeah
[01:28] oh okay i got it yeah well as a person
[01:30] who&#39;s uh
[01:31] very much into uh
[01:33] aerial travel as you are that&#39;s uh
[01:36] perfect that&#39;s pretty great yeah pretty
[01:37] great
[01:38] um
[01:39] so is it does it feel strange to have a
[01:42] child while this craziness is going does
[01:44] it feel like you&#39;ve had children before
[01:46] is this any weirder
[01:49] uh it&#39;s actually i think it&#39;s better uh
[01:52] being older and having a kid i
[01:54] appreciate it more
[01:56] um yeah
[01:57] babies are awesome they are pretty
[01:59] awesome they&#39;re awesome yeah when i
[02:01] didn&#39;t have my any of my own i would see
[02:03] other people&#39;s kids and i didn&#39;t not
[02:06] like them sure but i wasn&#39;t drawn to
[02:07] them sure but now when i see little
[02:09] people&#39;s kids i&#39;m like oh i think of
[02:11] them like these little love packages
[02:12] yeah little love bugs yeah it&#39;s just you
[02:15] you think of them differently when you
[02:16] see them come out and then grow and then
[02:18] eventually start talking to you
[02:20] like your whole idea what a baby is is
[02:22] very different yeah so now as you you
[02:24] know get older and get to appreciate it
[02:26] as a mature
[02:28] fully formed adult
[02:30] it must be really
[02:31] pretty wonderful yeah
[02:33] wonderful it&#39;s great but babies are
[02:34] awesome yeah yeah that&#39;s uh that&#39;s great
[02:37] um
[02:39] yeah um
[02:41] i mean also i&#39;ve i&#39;ve spent a lot of
[02:43] time on ai and neural nets and so you
[02:45] can sort of see
[02:47] the kind of the brain develop which is
[02:49] you know what
[02:51] an ai neural net is trying to simulate
[02:53] what a brain does basically um and you
[02:56] can sort of see the
[02:58] it
[02:58] learning very quickly
[03:01] you know it&#39;s just wow
[03:03] see things fire so you&#39;re talking about
[03:05] the neural net you&#39;re not talking about
[03:06] an actual baby i don&#39;t know about
[03:08] actually an actual baby but both of them
[03:10] yes but the word neural net comes from
[03:12] the the brain it&#39;s like a
[03:14] net of neurons
[03:16] so
[03:17] you know it&#39;s like the
[03:19] yeah
[03:20] humans are the
[03:22] you know original gangster the neural
[03:24] net
[03:26] that&#39;s a great way to put it yeah so
[03:28] when you&#39;re
[03:29] programming artificial intelligence
[03:31] where you&#39;re working with artificial
[03:32] intelligence art
[03:33] are they specifically trying to mimic
[03:36] the developmental process of a human
[03:38] brain
[03:41] in a lot of ways there&#39;s some ways that
[03:42] are different um you know an analogy
[03:45] that&#39;s often used is like you know we we
[03:47] don&#39;t make
[03:48] a submarine swim like a fish
[03:50] but we take the principles of of how
[03:54] you know what of hydrodynamics and apply
[03:57] them to a submarine i&#39;ve always wondered
[03:59] as a lay person do you try to achieve
[04:01] the same results as a human brain but
[04:03] through different methods or do you try
[04:05] to copy the way a human brain achieves
[04:07] results
[04:10] i mean the essential elements of
[04:13] an ai neural net are
[04:15] really very very similar to a
[04:18] human brain neural net yeah
[04:21] it&#39;s having the multiple layers of
[04:23] neurons and
[04:26] you know back propagation these all
[04:27] these things are what your brain does
[04:29] you know it&#39;s sort of
[04:31] yeah um
[04:33] you have a layer of neurons that goes
[04:35] through a series of intermediate steps
[04:36] to ultimately cognition and that and
[04:39] then it&#39;ll
[04:40] reverse those steps and go back and
[04:42] forth and go all over the place
[04:43] um
[04:45] it&#39;s um
[04:47] yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s
[04:49] interesting very interesting
[04:50] yeah i would imagine
[04:52] like the thought of programming
[04:54] something that is eventually going to be
[04:56] smarter than us
[04:58] that one day it&#39;s going to be like why
[05:00] did you do it that way
[05:01] like when artificial intelligence
[05:03] becomes sentient they&#39;re like oh you
[05:04] tried to mimic yourself like this so
[05:07] much better process cut out all this
[05:09] nonsense
[05:11] but like there are elements that are the
[05:12] same but just almost like like an
[05:14] aircraft does not fly like a bird
[05:17] right yeah it doesn&#39;t flap its wings
[05:19] but the wings
[05:21] the way the wings work and generate lift
[05:23] is the same as bird
[05:27] now you&#39;re
[05:28] in the middle of this uh
[05:30] this strange time where you&#39;re selling
[05:33] your houses you say you don&#39;t want any
[05:34] material possessions and i&#39;ve been
[05:36] seeing all that and i&#39;ve been really
[05:37] excited to talk to you about this yeah
[05:39] because it&#39;s an interesting thing to
[05:40] come from a guy like yourself
[05:42] like why are you doing that
[05:44] i&#39;m slightly sad about it actually
[05:46] but
[05:48] if you&#39;re sad about it why are you doing
[05:49] it
[05:54] i think i think possessions kind of
[05:56] weigh you down
[05:58] then they&#39;re kind of an attack vector
[06:01] you know people say hey billionaire you
[06:03] got all this stuff like well and now i
[06:05] don&#39;t have stuff now what are you gonna
[06:06] do
[06:08] attack vector meaning like people target
[06:10] it yeah um interesting yeah
[06:13] but you&#39;re obviously gonna so you&#39;re
[06:15] gonna rent a place yeah
[06:17] okay
[06:18] and get rid of everything except clothes
[06:21] no i said like almost everything
[06:23] so it&#39;s like keep a couple teslas
[06:25] yeah sure yeah kind of have to
[06:28] test product and stuff um
[06:30] yeah those things that have sentimental
[06:31] value for sure are keeping those here um
[06:37] yeah so do you feel like
[06:39] what&#39;s worse that could happen right
[06:41] you&#39;re fine
[06:42] yeah you could always buy more stuff if
[06:43] you don&#39;t like it
[06:45] especially yeah i mean from the money
[06:47] that you sell all your stuff you could
[06:48] buy new stuff
[06:50] but do you you feel like
[06:52] people
[06:53] define you by the fact that you&#39;re
[06:55] you&#39;re wealthy
[06:56] and that they define you in a pejorative
[06:58] way
[06:59] for sure i mean not everyone but right
[07:01] you know there&#39;s uh
[07:03] for sure in recent like years
[07:06] billionaire has become a per jar like
[07:08] it&#39;s in a projective so like it&#39;s like
[07:10] that&#39;s a bad thing um
[07:12] which i mean i think doesn&#39;t make a lot
[07:14] of sense in most cases if you&#39;ve if
[07:16] you&#39;re done if you basically
[07:18] uh
[07:19] organized a
[07:21] company like see like how do how does
[07:23] this wealth arise it&#39;s if you organize
[07:26] people in a in a better way to produce
[07:29] products and services that are better
[07:31] than what existed before
[07:33] and you have
[07:35] some ownership in that company then that
[07:38] that essentially gives you the right to
[07:40] allocate more capital
[07:42] so it&#39;s there&#39;s a conflation of
[07:45] consumption and capital allocation
[07:48] so
[07:50] let me say warren buffett for example
[07:52] and to get totally frank i&#39;m not his
[07:53] biggest fan but
[07:55] uh
[07:56] you know he does a lot of capital
[07:58] allocation
[07:59] um and he reads a lot of a lot of sort
[08:01] of annual reports of companies and
[08:03] all the accounting and it&#39;s pretty
[08:05] boring really um and he&#39;s trying to
[08:06] figure out is
[08:08] does coke or pepsi deserve more capital
[08:12] i mean that&#39;s
[08:13] i mean it&#39;s kind of a boring job if you
[08:14] ask me um
[08:16] but
[08:17] uh you know it&#39;s still a thing that&#39;s
[08:19] important to figure out like which is a
[08:21] company deserving of more or less
[08:23] capital should that company grow or
[08:24] expand is it making products and
[08:26] services that are
[08:28] better than others or worse and you know
[08:31] should
[08:31] you know
[08:33] if a company is making compelling
[08:35] products and services it should get more
[08:36] capital and if it&#39;s not it should get
[08:38] less we&#39;ll go out of business well
[08:40] there&#39;s a big difference too between
[08:42] someone who&#39;s making an incredible
[08:44] amount of money designing and
[08:47] engineering fantastic products versus
[08:49] someone who&#39;s making an incredible
[08:51] amount of money by
[08:53] investing in companies or moving money
[08:55] around in the stock market or doing
[08:57] things along those lines
[08:58] it&#39;s it&#39;s a different thing and to put
[09:00] them all in the same category seems
[09:02] it&#39;s it&#39;s very simple and as you pointed
[09:05] out it&#39;s an attack vector yeah for sure
[09:08] yeah i mean i think it&#39;s it&#39;s really
[09:11] i i do think they&#39;re
[09:12] in the in the united states especially
[09:14] there&#39;s an over allocation of talent uh
[09:17] in finance and law
[09:18] uh basically too many smart people go
[09:20] into finance and law
[09:23] so
[09:24] you know this is both a compliment and a
[09:26] criticism
[09:28] we should have of i think fewer people
[09:31] doing law and fewer people doing finance
[09:34] and more people making stuff
[09:37] yeah yeah well that would certainly be
[09:40] better for all involved if they made
[09:42] better stuff yeah yeah absolutely um
[09:45] and and you know manufacturing used to
[09:46] be highly valued in the united states
[09:50] and these days it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s often
[09:52] looked down upon which i think is wrong
[09:54] yeah
[09:55] well i think that people are kind of
[09:57] learning that
[09:59] particularly because of this whole
[10:01] pandemic and this relationship that we
[10:03] have with china
[10:05] that it there&#39;s a lot of value into
[10:07] making things into making things here
[10:10] yes somebody&#39;s got to do the the real
[10:12] work yeah you know and um
[10:15] you know
[10:16] like making a car it&#39;s an honest days
[10:18] that&#39;s not honest day is living that&#39;s
[10:19] for sure
[10:20] you know or making anything really or
[10:23] providing valuable service
[10:25] um like providing you know greater
[10:27] entertainment good information but these
[10:28] are all valuable things to do um
[10:32] you know so yeah there should be more
[10:35] more of it did you have a moment where
[10:38] is this something that this idea of
[10:40] getting rid of your material possessions
[10:41] is something that built up over time or
[10:44] did you have a moment of realization
[10:45] where you realize that
[10:47] yeah i&#39;ve been thinking about it for a
[10:48] while
[10:50] um
[10:51] you know part of it is like i
[10:54] like have a bunch of houses but
[10:57] i don&#39;t spend a lot of time in
[10:59] most of them and
[11:02] that doesn&#39;t seem like a good use of
[11:04] assets like somebody could probably be
[11:05] enjoying those houses and get better use
[11:08] of them than me so don&#39;t you have gene
[11:10] wilder&#39;s house i do that&#39;s amazing
[11:12] that&#39;s awesome wow
[11:15] exactly what you&#39;d expect did you
[11:17] request that the buyer not [ __ ] it up
[11:19] yeah that&#39;s a requirement
[11:20] oh a requirement that&#39;s that&#39;s a good
[11:22] requirement yeah not in that case in
[11:24] that house yeah it&#39;ll probably sell for
[11:26] last but still i don&#39;t care uh he&#39;s a
[11:28] legend yeah he would want his soul he&#39;d
[11:31] want his essence yeah in the building
[11:33] it&#39;s and it&#39;s there that&#39;s a real quirky
[11:36] quirky house yeah
[11:37] what what makes you say it&#39;s there like
[11:38] what do you get out of it
[11:41] um
[11:44] i mean all the all the cabinets are like
[11:46] handmade and they&#39;re like odd shapes and
[11:50] there&#39;s like doors to nowhere and
[11:53] strange like
[11:54] car doors and tunnels and
[11:56] really odd odd paintings on the wall and
[12:00] um yeah did you ever live in it it&#39;s
[12:02] very quirky
[12:03] i did live in it briefly yeah
[12:06] but why do you buy houses like if you
[12:08] own all these houses do you just get
[12:09] bored and go i think i&#39;d like to have
[12:11] that
[12:13] well i
[12:14] you know had one house and then
[12:17] the
[12:18] junior wilder house right across the
[12:19] road from me
[12:20] from from my main house and
[12:22] it was going to get it was going to get
[12:24] sold and then torn down and turned into
[12:26] you know be a big construction zone for
[12:28] three years and
[12:30] i was like well i think i&#39;ll i&#39;ll buy it
[12:32] and
[12:33] preserve
[12:35] the spurt of gene water and
[12:37] not have a giant construction zone and
[12:39] then
[12:40] the
[12:41] you know this i started having like some
[12:43] privacy issues where like people would
[12:45] like less people just like come to my
[12:47] house
[12:48] and
[12:49] you know
[12:51] start climbing over the walls and stuff
[12:53] i feel like man
[12:55] um
[12:56] so
[12:57] then i saw like what a house some of the
[12:59] houses around my house and then i
[13:01] thought at one point well
[13:03] you know it&#39;d be cool to to build a
[13:05] house so
[13:07] then i
[13:08] acquired some properties at the top of
[13:11] samara road uh and which is
[13:14] got a great view and it&#39;s like okay well
[13:16] these
[13:16] some bunch of sort of small older houses
[13:19] they&#39;re going to get torn down anyway i
[13:21] was like well you know if i collect
[13:23] these like little little houses then i
[13:25] can
[13:26] build something
[13:27] you know i don&#39;t know artistic like a
[13:29] you know
[13:31] dream house type of thing what&#39;s a dream
[13:33] house for elon musk like some tony stark
[13:35] type [ __ ] yeah definitely
[13:38] yeah you gotta have the the dome that
[13:40] opens up with the stealth helicopter and
[13:43] that kind of thing you know yeah for
[13:44] sure [ __ ] yeah yeah
[13:46] um but but then i was like man
[13:50] do i really want does it really make
[13:51] sense for me to spend time
[13:53] designing and building a house and i&#39;d
[13:55] be real
[13:56] you know
[13:57] get out like ocd on the little details
[14:00] and the design and
[14:02] or should i be allocating that time to
[14:04] getting us to mars i should probably do
[14:06] the latter
[14:07] so
[14:09] you know like what&#39;s more important mars
[14:10] or a house i like mars okay
[14:13] is that really how you think like that
[14:16] it&#39;d be better off
[14:17] planning on a trip to mars or getting
[14:20] people to mars
[14:21] yeah yeah definitely i mean
[14:24] you can only do so many things right
[14:26] right so how you can i don&#39;t know how
[14:27] you do what you do anyway i don&#39;t i
[14:29] don&#39;t understand how you can run bull
[14:30] with a boring company tesla
[14:33] spacex all these different things you&#39;re
[14:35] doing constantly i just i don&#39;t
[14:37] understand i mean you explained last
[14:39] time you were here how you sort of
[14:41] allocate your time and and how hectic it
[14:43] is and insane i still don&#39;t the the
[14:46] productivity
[14:47] is uh baffling just doesn&#39;t make sense
[14:49] how you can get so much done
[14:52] well i think i do have high productivity
[14:54] but even with that there&#39;s still some
[14:55] upgraded cost of time and
[14:58] allocating time to
[15:00] building a house even if it was a really
[15:02] great house
[15:03] it still is not a good use of time
[15:06] relative to
[15:07] developing the rockets necessary to get
[15:10] us to mars and helping sell sustainable
[15:12] energy
[15:13] uh
[15:14] spacex and tesla are by far
[15:17] you know by the the
[15:19] most amount of like brain cycles
[15:21] um
[15:23] you know boring company does not take
[15:25] you know like
[15:26] less than one percent of brain cycles
[15:28] and um
[15:29] and then this neural link which is
[15:33] i don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s like five
[15:34] percent
[15:36] and then five percent that&#39;s that&#39;s a
[15:37] good chunk it&#39;s a good chunk yeah yeah
[15:39] we were talking about that last time and
[15:40] you were
[15:41] trying to figure out when it was
[15:43] actually going to go live when it&#39;s
[15:45] actually going to be available
[15:47] are you testing on people right now
[15:50] no we&#39;re not testing people yet but i i
[15:52] think it won&#39;t be too long i think we
[15:54] may be able to
[15:56] implant a neurolink in
[16:01] less than a year
[16:02] in a person i think
[16:06] and when you do this is there any tests
[16:09] that you have to do before you do
[16:10] something like this to to see what
[16:12] percentage of people&#39;s bodies are going
[16:14] to reject these things
[16:16] is it put is it there is there a
[16:17] potential for rejection
[16:20] it&#39;s a very low potential for rejection
[16:23] i mean you can think of it like
[16:24] people put in
[16:26] you know heart monitors and um
[16:30] you know things for epileptic seizures
[16:32] and deep brain stimulation
[16:34] um obviously like you know artificial
[16:37] hips and right knees and that kind of
[16:39] thing so the probability of i mean like
[16:42] it&#39;s so it&#39;s well known like what will
[16:43] cause rejection what what will not um
[16:46] it&#39;s definitely harder when you&#39;ve got
[16:48] something that is
[16:53] sort of
[16:55] reading and writing neurons that&#39;s
[16:56] that&#39;s generating a current pulse and
[16:58] reading current pulses that&#39;s that&#39;s a
[17:00] little harder
[17:01] um
[17:05] then then say uh passive device but it&#39;s
[17:08] still you know very doable and um yeah
[17:11] there there are people who have
[17:12] primitive devices in in their brains
[17:14] right now
[17:15] what kind of devices i like deep brain
[17:18] stimulation is i think for parkinson&#39;s
[17:20] is
[17:22] like has
[17:23] really changed people&#39;s lives in a big
[17:25] way
[17:26] um
[17:27] which is kind of remarkable because it
[17:29] kind of like
[17:30] zaps your brain um it&#39;s like kicking the
[17:33] tv type of thing
[17:34] um and you think like man kicking the tv
[17:37] shouldn&#39;t work it does sometimes yeah
[17:39] yeah the old old tvs it did my grandpa
[17:42] used to slap the top for sure
[17:44] yeah it would work sometimes yeah so
[17:46] this deep right simulation uh implanted
[17:48] devices in the brain that uh
[17:50] have changed people&#39;s lives for the
[17:51] better like fundamentally well let&#39;s
[17:53] talk about what you can talk about to
[17:55] what neurolink is because the last time
[17:57] you were here you really couldn&#39;t
[17:58] discuss it and then there was a i guess
[18:01] a press release or something that sort
[18:02] of outlined yeah that that happened
[18:05] quite a bit after the last time you were
[18:06] here so what exactly
[18:09] is it how do you do what what happens if
[18:12] someone
[18:13] ultimately does get a neurolink
[18:15] installed what will take place
[18:18] well for version one of the device it
[18:20] would be
[18:22] it basically implanted in your skull
[18:26] so but it would be
[18:29] flush with your skull so you basically
[18:33] uh take out a chunk of skull replace put
[18:36] the neurologic device in there
[18:37] um
[18:38] you put the
[18:40] the electrode you&#39;d insert the electrode
[18:42] threads very carefully into the the
[18:44] brain
[18:45] and
[18:46] uh and then you
[18:49] you know
[18:50] stitch it up and um and you wouldn&#39;t
[18:52] even know that somebody has it
[18:54] and then and and so then it it can
[18:56] interface basically anywhere
[18:58] in any anywhere in your brain um so it
[19:00] could be something that uh you know
[19:02] helps cure say uh eyesight like give you
[19:05] returns your eyesight even if you&#39;ve
[19:07] like lost your optic nerve type of thing
[19:09] uh really yeah yeah absolutely hearing
[19:12] obviously um
[19:14] i mean pretty much anything that where
[19:17] that it could in principle fix almost
[19:19] anything that is wrong with the brain
[19:21] and it could
[19:24] restore uh
[19:26] limb functionality so if you&#39;ve got uh
[19:28] interface into the motor cortex and then
[19:31] an implant that&#39;s say
[19:34] that&#39;s like a microcontroller
[19:37] and near muscle groups uh you you could
[19:39] then create a
[19:40] sort of a neural shunt that restores
[19:44] somebody who&#39;s a quadriplegic to full
[19:46] functionality
[19:48] like they can walk around be normal
[19:51] whoa yeah so maybe slightly better
[19:54] slightly better over time yes you mean
[19:57] with future iterations like the you know
[19:59] six million dollar man although these
[20:00] days that would that doesn&#39;t matter
[20:02] yeah
[20:04] six billion dollars
[20:05] so the
[20:07] the hole would be small how big would
[20:09] the hole be that you have to drill and
[20:10] then replace with this piece
[20:13] it&#39;s only one hole
[20:14] well
[20:15] um
[20:16] yeah the device we&#39;re working on right
[20:18] now is about
[20:21] it&#39;s about an inch in diameter
[20:23] um and your skull is pretty thick by the
[20:25] way so skulls are mine is for sure it
[20:27] might actually literally
[20:29] um i mean if you&#39;re a big if you&#39;re a
[20:31] big guy your skull is actually
[20:33] fairly thick um
[20:34] skulls like it&#39;s like seven to 14
[20:36] millimeters
[20:38] um so that&#39;s probably a couple inches a
[20:40] half inch you know half inch thick skull
[20:42] ish
[20:43] so
[20:44] um yeah yeah so that&#39;s a fair bit of
[20:47] like our
[20:48] we got quite a coconut going on here
[20:50] it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like some egg shell oh
[20:51] yeah i believe you um so the
[20:54] yeah you basically
[20:56] implant the device uh and so you would
[20:58] be like a one inch square
[21:01] one inch in diameter yeah like so an
[21:03] inch circle like a circular yeah i think
[21:05] like a like a smart watch or something
[21:07] like that
[21:09] okay
[21:09] yeah
[21:11] okay so you take this one-inch diameter
[21:13] like ice fishing right you ever go ice
[21:15] fishing um no but i&#39;d like to it&#39;s great
[21:18] yeah it&#39;s really fun so you basically
[21:20] take an auger and you
[21:23] you drill through the surface of the ice
[21:25] yeah and you create a small hole and you
[21:27] can dunk your line in there so this is
[21:29] like that you&#39;re ice fishing on the top
[21:30] of your skull and then you cork it
[21:33] yeah and you replace that
[21:36] say one inch diameter piece of skull
[21:38] with this neural link device
[21:41] and that has a battery and a and a
[21:44] bluetooth and a inductive charger um and
[21:47] then you
[21:48] and and now then you also got to insert
[21:50] the electrodes uh so the electrode is
[21:52] very carefully inserted uh with our
[21:56] with a robot that we developed uh that&#39;s
[21:59] you know very carefully putting in the
[22:00] electrodes and avoiding you know and any
[22:02] veins or arteries uh so it&#39;s
[22:05] you know doesn&#39;t create trauma so
[22:07] through this one-inch diameter
[22:09] device electrodes be inserted and they
[22:12] will find their way like tiny wires
[22:14] basically tiny wires
[22:15] and they&#39;ll find their way to specific
[22:17] areas of the brain to stimulate no you
[22:19] literally put them where they&#39;re
[22:21] supposed to go oh
[22:23] okay yeah
[22:24] how long will these wires be
[22:26] uh i mean they usually go in like you
[22:28] know
[22:30] depending on where it is like
[22:33] you know two or three millimeters
[22:35] so they just find the spots yeah
[22:38] wow um and then um
[22:42] yeah then
[22:43] you put the device in and
[22:45] that that gets uh that that replaces the
[22:48] little piece of skull that was taken out
[22:50] uh and then you
[22:52] you stitch up the hole and and um and
[22:55] you just have it look like a little scar
[22:57] and that&#39;s it well this would be
[22:58] replaceable or reversible yes like if
[23:00] someone can&#39;t take it anymore i&#39;m too
[23:02] smart i can&#39;t take it yeah you can
[23:04] totally check it out and what is the
[23:06] besides
[23:08] restoring limb function and eyesight and
[23:10] hearing which are all amazing is there
[23:11] are there any cognitive benefits that
[23:13] you anticipate from something like this
[23:16] uh yeah i mean you could for sure um
[23:19] uh
[23:21] i mean basically
[23:22] it&#39;s a
[23:24] generalized um
[23:28] sort of
[23:29] uh
[23:31] thing for for fixing any kind of brain
[23:33] injury in in principle like if you or if
[23:35] you&#39;ve got like like severe epilepsy or
[23:37] something like that it could it could
[23:38] just it could just sort of stop the
[23:40] epilepsy from occurring like it could
[23:41] detect it in real time and then fire a
[23:44] counter pulse and stop the epilepsy um
[23:48] if um
[23:50] i mean there&#39;s a whole range of brain
[23:52] injuries like if somebody gets a stroke
[23:54] they could lose the ability to speak
[23:56] um you know that that&#39;ll stack could
[23:58] also be fixed so if you&#39;ve got like
[24:00] stroke damage or if you lose say
[24:03] you know muscle control over part of
[24:04] your face or something like that i think
[24:07] and then when when you get old you tend
[24:09] to
[24:10] if you get like you know alzheimer&#39;s or
[24:12] something like that then you lose memory
[24:15] and this could help you with
[24:17] you know restoring your memory that kind
[24:18] of thing
[24:19] restoring memory and what what is
[24:21] happening that&#39;s allowing it to do that
[24:23] like the wires these small wires
[24:26] stimulating these areas of the brain and
[24:27] then is it that the areas of the brain
[24:29] are they&#39;re they&#39;re losing some sort of
[24:32] electrical force like what it what is
[24:33] happening yeah
[24:35] yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s like i think
[24:37] it&#39;s like a bunch of circuits and
[24:38] there&#39;s some
[24:40] like circuits that are broken and we can
[24:42] like
[24:44] uh
[24:45] fix those circuits
[24:46] substitute for those circuit circuits
[24:48] and so a specific frequency will go
[24:50] through this yeah specific in that
[24:54] would
[24:55] is the process figuring out how much or
[24:58] how little has to be how how much
[25:01] these areas of the brain have to be
[25:02] juiced up
[25:03] yeah i mean there&#39;s still a lot of work
[25:05] to do so when i say
[25:07] you know we got a shot at probably
[25:09] putting it in in a person in
[25:12] you know a within a year i think that&#39;s
[25:14] that&#39;s what that&#39;s exactly what i mean i
[25:16] think we have a chance of putting input
[25:17] into one and having them
[25:19] having them
[25:20] be healthy and
[25:22] and restoring some functionality that
[25:24] they&#39;ve lost the fear is that eventually
[25:27] you&#39;re gonna have to cut the whole top
[25:29] of someone&#39;s head off and put a new top
[25:32] with a whole bunch of wires if you want
[25:34] to get
[25:35] you know the real turbocharged
[25:37] version
[25:39] the p100d
[25:41] of brain stimulation
[25:45] i mean ultimately if you if you want to
[25:47] go with full ai symbiosis
[25:50] you&#39;ll probably
[25:52] want to do something like that symbiosis
[25:54] is a scary word when it comes to ai
[25:57] it&#39;s optional
[25:58] [Laughter]
[26:01] i would hope so yeah it&#39;s just i mean
[26:04] once you enjoy the dr manhattan
[26:07] lifestyle once you once you become a god
[26:10] seems
[26:10] very
[26:11] very unlikely you&#39;re going to want to go
[26:13] back to being stupid again
[26:15] i mean you you literally could
[26:16] fundamentally change the way human
[26:18] beings interface with each other
[26:20] yes
[26:21] yes
[26:22] you wouldn&#39;t need to talk
[26:27] i&#39;m so scared of that but so excited
[26:28] about it at the same time is that weird
[26:32] yeah i mean
[26:33] the i think this is one of the paths to
[26:36] um
[26:40] you know i think like what
[26:42] like ai is getting better and better um
[26:45] so
[26:46] now let&#39;s assume it&#39;s sort of like a
[26:47] benign ai scenario
[26:49] even in a benign scenario we&#39;re kind of
[26:51] left behind
[26:52] you know we&#39;re we&#39;re not we&#39;re not along
[26:54] for the ride
[26:55] um we&#39;re just too dumb
[26:56] right
[26:58] so so how do you go along for the ride
[27:00] um
[27:01] yeah so you can&#39;t beat them join them so
[27:05] um and we&#39;re already we&#39;re already a
[27:08] cyborg to some degree right because
[27:10] you&#39;ve got your phone you&#39;ve got your
[27:11] laptop glasses yeah yeah guitar
[27:14] electronic devices
[27:16] and
[27:18] i mean today if you your phone if you if
[27:21] you don&#39;t bring your phone along it&#39;s
[27:22] like you have missing limb syndrome
[27:24] that&#39;s like you know it feels like
[27:25] something&#39;s really really missing so
[27:28] we&#39;re already
[27:29] partly
[27:31] um
[27:33] part you know partly a cyborg um or an
[27:35] ai symbiote essentially
[27:38] um
[27:40] it&#39;s just that the data rate to the
[27:42] electronics is slow
[27:44] so
[27:45] especially output like you&#39;re just going
[27:47] with your thumbs
[27:49] i don&#39;t know like
[27:50] what&#39;s your data rate maybe
[27:52] optimistically 100 bits per second
[27:54] that&#39;s being generous
[27:56] um
[27:57] and now the computer can
[27:59] communicate at like you know 100
[28:02] terabits
[28:03] you know
[28:04] so
[28:05] so certainly you know
[28:07] gigabits are a trivial at this point
[28:10] so this this is like
[28:13] you know basically
[28:14] your computer could do a mil do things a
[28:16] million
[28:17] times faster or
[28:21] at a certain point it&#39;s like talk they
[28:22] as like talking to a tree
[28:25] okay it&#39;s boring
[28:26] you talk to a tree
[28:28] it&#39;s very not very entertaining
[28:30] um so
[28:33] um
[28:34] so if you if you can
[28:36] solve the the data rate
[28:38] issue and your especially output but
[28:40] input two then
[28:42] you can
[28:43] improve the
[28:44] symbiosis that is already occurring
[28:46] between
[28:47] mana machine
[28:49] so you you can improve it
[28:51] in what when you said you won&#39;t have to
[28:53] talk to each other anymore we used to
[28:55] joke around about that i i&#39;ve joked
[28:57] around about that a million times in
[28:58] this podcast that one day in the future
[29:00] there&#39;s going to come a time where you
[29:01] can read each other&#39;s minds and well
[29:03] you&#39;ll be able to interface with each
[29:05] other in some sort of a non-verbal
[29:07] non-physical way where you will transfer
[29:10] data back and forth to each other
[29:12] without having to actually use your
[29:13] mouth
[29:15] and make noises
[29:17] exactly so when you
[29:18] like what happens when you when like
[29:20] let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got some complex idea
[29:22] that you&#39;re trying to convey to somebody
[29:23] else and how do you do that
[29:25] well your brain spends a lot of effort
[29:28] compressing
[29:29] a complex concept
[29:32] into words
[29:33] and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot a lot of
[29:35] loss
[29:36] information loss that occurs when
[29:38] compressing a complex concept into words
[29:41] and then you say those words those words
[29:43] are then interpreted then they&#39;re
[29:44] decompressed by the person who is
[29:46] listening
[29:47] and they they will at best get a very
[29:50] incomplete understanding of what you&#39;re
[29:51] trying to convey it&#39;s very difficult to
[29:53] convey a complex concept with precision
[29:56] because you&#39;ve got
[29:58] compression
[29:59] decompression
[30:01] you may not even have heard all the
[30:03] words correctly
[30:05] and so
[30:06] communication is difficult you know what
[30:08] we have here is a failure to communicate
[30:11] cool and luke yes and there&#39;s a great
[30:13] movie yeah
[30:15] there&#39;s an interpretation factor too
[30:17] like you can
[30:18] choose to interpret
[30:20] certain series of words in in different
[30:23] ways and they&#39;re dependent upon tone
[30:26] dependent upon social cues
[30:29] even facial expressions sarcasm there&#39;s
[30:31] a lot of variables sarcasm is difficult
[30:34] yes yeah and so
[30:37] one of the things that
[30:38] i i&#39;ve said is like that there could be
[30:41] potentially a universal language that&#39;s
[30:43] created through computers that
[30:45] particularly young kids would pick up
[30:47] very quickly like my kids do tick tock
[30:50] and all this jazz and i don&#39;t know what
[30:51] they&#39;re doing they just know how to do
[30:53] it and they know how to do it really
[30:54] quickly like they learn really quickly
[30:56] they show me how to edit things and yeah
[30:58] it&#39;s if you taught a child from first
[31:00] grade on how to use some new universal
[31:03] language i mean essentially like a
[31:05] rosetta stone
[31:07] and
[31:08] something that&#39;s done
[31:09] that interprets
[31:11] your thoughts and you can convey your
[31:13] thoughts with no room for interpretation
[31:16] with clear very clear that where you
[31:19] know what a person&#39;s saying and you can
[31:21] tell them
[31:22] what you&#39;re saying and there&#39;s no need
[31:25] for noises no need for mouth noises no
[31:27] need for
[31:28] these sort of accepted ways that we&#39;ve
[31:31] uh sort of evolved to make sounds that
[31:35] we all agree
[31:37] we through our cultural dictionary right
[31:40] we agree or certainly we could bypass
[31:42] all that yeah we can still do it for for
[31:44] sentimental reasons right
[31:46] like campfires
[31:48] yeah yeah exactly i don&#39;t need campfires
[31:49] i don&#39;t need to roast marshmallows kind
[31:52] of fun right um
[31:53] so yeah um
[31:56] yeah i think you would in principle you
[31:58] would be able to communicate
[32:02] very quickly
[32:04] and
[32:05] with far
[32:06] more precision
[32:08] ideas
[32:10] and
[32:10] language would
[32:13] i&#39;m not sure what would happen to
[32:14] language but you could probably within a
[32:16] situation like this that you would be
[32:17] able to just kind of like the matrix you
[32:19] you want to speak a different language
[32:20] in a problem right that&#39;s why it just
[32:22] downloaded the program
[32:25] right so
[32:27] at least for the first iterations first
[32:29] few iterations we&#39;ll just be able to use
[32:31] like i i know that google has uh their
[32:35] some of their pixel buds have the
[32:38] ability to interpret languages in real
[32:40] time
[32:41] sure yeah you can hear it and they&#39;ll
[32:42] it&#39;ll play things back to you in
[32:44] whatever language you choose so to be
[32:46] something along those lines
[32:49] yeah for the first few iterations
[32:52] well the first few iterations are i mean
[32:54] what i&#39;m talking about is like in the
[32:55] limit over time you know with a lot of
[32:58] development um the first few iterations
[33:01] really in the first
[33:02] few versions all we&#39;re going to be
[33:03] trying to do is solve brain injuries um
[33:06] so so it&#39;s like don&#39;t don&#39;t worry that
[33:08] that&#39;s not going to sneak up on you
[33:11] this this will take a while how many
[33:12] years
[33:15] before you don&#39;t have to talk
[33:19] if the if the development
[33:23] continues to accelerate then
[33:27] maybe
[33:28] like five years
[33:30] five to ten years that&#39;s quick
[33:32] that&#39;s really quick that&#39;s the best case
[33:34] scenario no talking anymore in five
[33:36] years best case scenario
[33:38] but i&#39;m 10 10 years more like it
[33:41] i&#39;ve always speculated that aliens could
[33:43] potentially be us in the future because
[33:46] if you look at like the size their heads
[33:48] and the fact that they have very little
[33:50] muscle and then they don&#39;t use their
[33:51] mouth anymore they was tiny little i
[33:53] mean the archetypal alien that you see
[33:55] in like closing counters are the third
[33:57] kind they they&#39;re like if you went from
[34:00] like uh
[34:01] australopithecus or ancient hominid to
[34:05] us what&#39;s the difference less hair less
[34:07] muscle bigger head
[34:09] and then just keep going a thousand a
[34:12] million whatever you or five years
[34:14] whatever whatever happens when neurolink
[34:17] goes on online and then we slowly start
[34:21] to adapt to this new way of being
[34:25] where we don&#39;t use our muscles anymore
[34:27] we have this gigantic head we can talk
[34:29] without words
[34:31] you could also
[34:33] save state
[34:36] and save state save state like save your
[34:38] brain state like like a saved game in a
[34:40] video game whoa
[34:42] like like if you want to swap from
[34:44] windows 95
[34:46] well
[34:50] yeah i think we are windows 95 right now
[34:52] yeah
[34:53] from a future perspective probably um
[34:56] but yeah i mean you you could
[34:58] save state
[35:00] um
[35:01] and restore that state into a biological
[35:03] being if you if you wanted to in the
[35:05] future in principle it&#39;s like nothing
[35:06] like from a physics standpoint that
[35:07] prevents us now you&#39;d be a little
[35:09] different but then you&#39;re also a little
[35:10] different when you wake up in the
[35:11] morning from yesterday and you&#39;re a
[35:12] little different in fact if you say like
[35:15] you five years ago versus you today is
[35:17] quite a big difference yes um so
[35:20] you&#39;d be substantially you i mean you&#39;d
[35:22] be you&#39;d certainly think you&#39;re you but
[35:23] the idea of saving yourself and then
[35:27] transforming that into some sort of a
[35:29] biological state like you can hang out
[35:32] with 30 year old you
[35:35] i mean the possibilities are endless
[35:39] that&#39;s so weird i mean these things
[35:41] think like how your phone can you can
[35:43] record videos on your phone like there&#39;s
[35:45] no way you could remember a video right
[35:47] as accurately as your phone or a camera
[35:49] you know could
[35:51] so
[35:52] uh
[35:53] now if you&#39;ve got like a you know some
[35:55] some
[35:55] you know version 10 hero link whatever
[35:58] and far in the future
[36:00] you could
[36:01] you could remember you could
[36:03] recall everything but just like it&#39;s a
[36:05] movie
[36:06] concluding all the entire sensory
[36:08] experience emotions everything
[36:10] everything everything
[36:12] and play it back
[36:14] and you can enjoy it you should edit it
[36:16] edit it yeah so you can change your past
[36:19] you could change what do you think was
[36:21] your past yeah well so if you had like a
[36:23] tremendous thing right now
[36:25] could be a replayed memory it could be
[36:28] yeah it may be
[36:30] what&#39;s the odds of this being a replayed
[36:32] memory if you had a guess
[36:34] it&#39;s more than 50
[36:37] there&#39;s no way to assign a probability
[36:39] with accuracy here right but roughly
[36:44] if you just had a just gut instinct
[36:49] well i don&#39;t have a neural link in my
[36:50] brain so i say right now zero percent
[36:55] but at the point at which you do have a
[36:56] neural link then it rises above zero
[36:59] percent
[37:02] the idea that we&#39;re experiencing some
[37:05] sort of a preserved memory
[37:07] is uh
[37:09] even though it&#39;s still the same it&#39;s not
[37:11] comforting
[37:12] right for some reason when we people
[37:14] talk about
[37:15] simulation theory they talk about the
[37:17] potential for this currently being a
[37:19] simulation it even though your life
[37:21] might be wonderful you might be in love
[37:24] you might love your career you might
[37:26] have great friends
[37:28] but it&#39;s not comforting to know that
[37:30] this experience somehow or another
[37:32] doesn&#39;t exist in a material form that
[37:33] you can knock
[37:34] on it feels real doesn&#39;t it feels real
[37:37] but but if it&#39;s not but the idea that
[37:39] it&#39;s not is for some strange reason
[37:43] disconcerting well yeah i&#39;m sure it
[37:46] should be disconcerting
[37:48] because then if this is not real what is
[37:50] right um but but the you know there&#39;s
[37:52] that that old sort of um
[37:55] thought experiment of like
[37:57] how do you know you&#39;re not a brain in a
[37:58] vet
[37:59] you know i mean now here&#39;s the thing you
[38:02] are a brain an event then that fat is
[38:04] your skull yes and everything you see
[38:06] feel here
[38:08] everything all your senses are
[38:10] electrical signals everything
[38:12] everything
[38:16] is an electrical signal to up to a brain
[38:18] in a vat where the vat is called and all
[38:20] your hormones all your neurotransmitters
[38:23] all these things are drugs adrenaline&#39;s
[38:25] a drug dopamine&#39;s a drug you&#39;re a drug
[38:28] factory
[38:30] you&#39;re constantly changing your state
[38:31] with love and oxytocin and
[38:34] and beauty sure changes your state great
[38:37] music changes your state absolutely
[38:41] and yet here&#39;s another
[38:43] sort of interesting idea which is um
[38:46] because you say like where did
[38:48] consciousness arise well assuming you
[38:50] believe
[38:51] the
[38:52] belief in physics which appears to be
[38:54] true um
[38:56] then you know we the universe started
[38:58] off as basically quarks and leptons and
[39:01] it quickly became hydrogen
[39:03] and of helium lithium like basically
[39:05] elements the periodic table
[39:07] but it was like mostly hydrogen
[39:09] basically
[39:11] and then
[39:12] and then over a long period of time
[39:15] uh
[39:16] you know 13.8 billion years later
[39:19] that hydrogen became sentient
[39:23] but
[39:24] so where
[39:25] along the way
[39:27] that conju where is the consciousness
[39:29] what&#39;s the line of consciousness and not
[39:30] consciousness right between hydrogen and
[39:33] here
[39:34] right when do we call it when do we call
[39:36] it consciousness i was watching a video
[39:38] today that we played on a podcast
[39:39] earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle
[39:42] down the street jumps off the motorcycle
[39:44] and tries to steal a baby yeah i saw
[39:45] that one they went apparel what is that
[39:48] monkey conscious it seems like it is it
[39:50] seems like it had a plan it was riding a
[39:52] [ __ ] motorcycle and then jumped off
[39:54] the motorcycle to try to steal a baby
[39:57] seems pretty the one that just strike
[39:59] baby down the street pretty far yeah
[40:00] yeah
[40:01] seems pretty conscious
[40:04] right
[40:05] there&#39;s definitely some degree of
[40:07] consciousness there yeah it&#39;s not like
[40:10] it&#39;s not a worm it seems to be on
[40:11] another level
[40:13] yeah and it&#39;s going to keep going and
[40:15] that that&#39;s the real concern
[40:19] when when people think about the
[40:21] potential future versions of human
[40:23] beings especially when you consider
[40:25] symbiotic relationship to artificial
[40:27] intelligence it will be unrecognizable
[40:29] that one day we&#39;ll be so far removed
[40:32] from what this is we&#39;ll look back on
[40:33] this
[40:34] the way we look back now on you know
[40:37] simple
[40:38] simple organisms that we evolved from
[40:41] and then it won&#39;t be that far in the
[40:43] future that we do have this this view
[40:45] back
[40:47] well i hope consciousness propagates
[40:48] into the future and it gets more
[40:50] more sophisticated and complex and
[40:52] and that it understands the
[40:55] questions to ask about the universe
[40:58] do you think that&#39;s the case
[41:00] as a human being as yourself you&#39;re
[41:01] clearly
[41:03] trying to make conscious decisions to be
[41:05] a better version of you right this is
[41:07] the idea of like getting rid of your
[41:09] possessions and realizing that you&#39;re
[41:11] trying to like i don&#39;t like this i will
[41:13] try to improve this i will try to do a
[41:16] better version of the way i interface
[41:18] with reality
[41:19] that this is always the way things are
[41:21] if you&#39;re if you&#39;re moving in a
[41:24] some sort of a direction where you&#39;re
[41:26] trying to improve things you&#39;re always
[41:28] going to move
[41:29] into this new place where you look back
[41:31] in the old place and go i was doing it
[41:32] wrong back then
[41:35] so this is an accelerated version of
[41:36] that
[41:37] super accelerated version of that
[41:40] i mean
[41:42] you don&#39;t always improve but you can
[41:43] aspire to improve
[41:44] you can aspire to be less wrong yeah
[41:47] this is like i think a good the tools of
[41:50] physics are very powerful like just
[41:52] assume you&#39;re wrong and you&#39;re asking
[41:53] your goals to be less wrong
[41:55] i don&#39;t think you&#39;re gonna if you
[41:57] succeed every day and being less wrong
[41:58] but you know
[42:00] if you&#39;re gonna succeed in being less
[42:01] wrong
[42:02] most of the time you&#39;re doing great
[42:04] that&#39;s a great way of putting aspire to
[42:06] be less wrong
[42:07] but then when you know people look back
[42:09] at nostalgia about simpler times there&#39;s
[42:12] that too it&#39;s very romantic and exciting
[42:14] to look back on
[42:16] campfires
[42:18] but you can still have a campfire yes
[42:19] yeah but will you appreciate it when
[42:21] you&#39;re a super nerd when you&#39;re
[42:22] connected to the grid and you have some
[42:24] uh skull cap in place of the top of your
[42:27] head and it&#39;s interfacing with the inter
[42:30] international language
[42:32] that the rest of the universe now enjoys
[42:34] communication with people
[42:36] and we&#39;re yeah
[42:38] sure i think so
[42:40] yeah i like empires
[42:41] [Laughter]
[42:43] i&#39;m just worried i mean uh everyone&#39;s
[42:45] always scared of change but i&#39;m scared
[42:47] of this monumental change where we won&#39;t
[42:49] we won&#39;t talk anymore
[42:51] i mean that thing will communicate yes
[42:53] but that&#39;s
[42:55] there&#39;s something about
[42:57] there&#39;s something about the beauty of
[42:58] the crudeness of language
[43:00] where when it&#39;s done eloquently it&#39;s
[43:03] it&#39;s it&#39;s satisfying and
[43:05] it it it
[43:06] hits us in some sort of a visceral way
[43:08] like ah that person nailed it i love
[43:11] that they nailed it like that it&#39;s so
[43:12] hard to capture
[43:14] a real thought and convey it in a way
[43:17] in this articulate way that makes
[43:19] someone except like you read a quote a
[43:20] great quote by a wise person it makes
[43:23] you excited that their mind
[43:25] figured something out put the words
[43:26] together in a right way that makes your
[43:28] brain pop like oh yes
[43:31] yeah yes
[43:32] it&#39;s clever compression of a concept
[43:35] yeah and a feeling
[43:36] but the fact that a human did it too
[43:38] yeah absolutely do you think that it&#39;ll
[43:40] be like electronic music like people
[43:42] won&#39;t appreciate it like they appreciate
[43:43] a slide guitar
[43:46] i like electronic music i do too yeah
[43:49] well you make it i know you liked it
[43:51] yeah
[43:52] yeah yeah um
[43:55] yeah i mean i hope the future is more
[43:57] fun and interesting and we should try to
[43:59] make that way
[44:00] i hope it&#39;s more fun and interesting too
[44:02] yeah
[44:03] i just
[44:04] you know i just hope you don&#39;t lose
[44:05] anything along the way
[44:07] yeah we might at least little but
[44:09] hopefully we&#39;ll gain more than lose yeah
[44:11] that&#39;s the thing right gaining more than
[44:12] we lose like something that makes us
[44:14] interesting is that we&#39;re so flawed it&#39;s
[44:16] not for sure right yeah
[44:20] i mean you look at civilizations through
[44:21] the ages um
[44:23] most of them uh you know they rose and
[44:24] fell yeah and uh
[44:28] i do think like the
[44:30] globalization
[44:31] uh that that we have
[44:35] at the sort of like the the meme sphere
[44:38] uh is uh
[44:39] there&#39;s not enough isolation between
[44:42] countries
[44:43] or regions
[44:44] um
[44:46] it&#39;s like if you get up if there&#39;s a
[44:47] mind virus
[44:49] that that my virus cannot infect too
[44:51] much of the world
[44:52] uh you know like i actually
[44:55] sort of sympathize with the
[44:56] anti-globalization people because it&#39;s
[44:59] it&#39;s like man we don&#39;t ever want
[45:00] everywhere to be the same for sure and
[45:02] then we we need some kind of like mind
[45:05] viral immunity
[45:08] so
[45:09] that that&#39;s it&#39;s a bit concerning mind
[45:11] viral immunity meaning that once
[45:14] something like neural link gets
[45:15] established the real concern is
[45:18] something that i mean you said it&#39;s
[45:20] bluetooth right or some future version
[45:22] of that that the idea is that something
[45:24] could possibly get into it [ __ ] it up no
[45:28] i&#39;m talking about like uh somebody
[45:29] there&#39;s some cockeyed concept that um
[45:35] that&#39;s happened that happens right right
[45:36] now
[45:37] yeah
[45:39] well i know there&#39;s viruses and embedded
[45:40] chips right like people have
[45:43] they&#39;ve embedded chips and then acquired
[45:45] viruses well when i&#39;m talking about my
[45:46] verse i&#39;m talking about like a a concept
[45:50] that affects people&#39;s minds
[45:51] oh okay okay
[45:54] like uh
[45:55] cult thinking or yeah some sort of
[45:57] fundamentalism yeah just
[46:00] wrong-headed idea that yes goes
[46:03] viral in a
[46:04] in an idea sense
[46:06] [Music]
[46:08] well that is that is a problem too right
[46:09] if someone can manipulate that
[46:11] technology to make something appear
[46:13] logical or rational
[46:16] yeah yeah that would that be an issue
[46:19] too with
[46:20] this is a very have versus have not
[46:22] issue right once this thing if if this
[46:25] really does
[46:26] i mean initially it&#39;s going to help
[46:28] people with with injuries and but you
[46:30] you said
[46:31] ultimately it could lead to this
[46:33] spectacular cognitive change yes but the
[46:36] people that first get it
[46:38] should have a massive advantage
[46:41] over people that don&#39;t have it yet
[46:43] well i mean it&#39;s the kind of thing where
[46:45] your productivity would improve
[46:47] i don&#39;t know dramatically maybe by a
[46:49] factor of 10 with it so
[46:52] you could definitely just
[46:54] you know uh i don&#39;t know take out a loan
[46:57] and do it and earn earn the money back
[46:59] real fast
[47:00] so you&#39;re super smart
[47:02] well
[47:03] in a capitalist society
[47:05] you know you could it seems like you
[47:07] could really get so far ahead that
[47:08] before everybody else could afford this
[47:11] thing and link up and get connected as
[47:13] well you&#39;d be so far ahead they could
[47:15] never catch you
[47:17] is that a concern uh
[47:19] well
[47:21] i think the the
[47:23] it&#39;s not a super huge concern i mean
[47:25] there are huge differences in cognitive
[47:26] ability and and resources already yeah
[47:29] um
[47:30] i mean you can think of a corporation as
[47:31] like a
[47:32] cybernetic collective
[47:34] uh that&#39;s
[47:35] far smarter than an individual like i i
[47:38] can personally build like a whole rocket
[47:40] and and the engines and launch it and
[47:42] everything that&#39;s impossible uh but
[47:45] you know we have eight thousand people
[47:46] with spacex and
[47:49] you
[47:49] might
[47:51] you know piecing it out to different
[47:53] people
[47:54] um
[47:55] and using like you know computers and
[47:57] machines and stuff we can make
[48:00] lots of rockets launch and all but
[48:02] stuck with the space station that kind
[48:03] of thing you know um so
[48:07] that already exists where this
[48:10] you know where there&#39;s a
[48:11] corporations are vastly more capable
[48:13] than an individual
[48:16] um
[48:17] but the the
[48:20] like we should be i think less concerned
[48:22] about like relative
[48:25] capabilities between people and and more
[48:27] like
[48:28] uh
[48:31] having ai be vastly
[48:33] you know beyond us and
[48:35] decoupled from human will
[48:38] decoupled from human so this is the if
[48:41] you can&#39;t beat them join them
[48:43] yeah i mean so you feel like it&#39;s
[48:45] inevitable like ai sentient ai is
[48:48] essentially inevitable super sentient ai
[48:50] yeah
[48:52] like beyond a level that&#39;s difficult to
[48:54] understand
[48:56] and impossible to understand probably
[48:58] and somehow or another
[49:00] us
[49:01] so it&#39;s almost like
[49:04] it&#39;s a
[49:05] requirement for survival to
[49:08] achieve some sort of symbiotic existence
[49:11] with ai
[49:12] it&#39;s not a requirement it&#39;s
[49:14] just um
[49:18] if you if you want to be along for the
[49:20] ride
[49:22] then you need to do some kind of
[49:24] symbiosis so the the way your brain
[49:26] works right now you&#39;ve got uh
[49:29] kind of like the animal brain reptile
[49:30] brain kind of let&#39;s
[49:33] say
[49:34] it&#39;s like the limbic system basically
[49:36] and you&#39;ve got the the cortex
[49:38] um
[49:39] now the brain purists will argue with
[49:41] this definition but essentially you&#39;ve
[49:42] got
[49:44] the primitive brain and you&#39;ve got the
[49:45] the sort of
[49:48] smart brain or the brain that&#39;s capable
[49:50] of planning and understanding concepts
[49:52] and different difficult you know things
[49:54] that a monkey can&#39;t understand um
[49:58] now the
[49:59] your cortex is much much smarter than
[50:01] your olympic system
[50:03] um
[50:04] nonetheless they work together well
[50:07] so i haven&#39;t met anyone who wants to
[50:08] delete the olympic system or the cortex
[50:11] that people are quite happy having both
[50:13] um
[50:14] so you can think of the
[50:16] this as being
[50:17] like the computer the ai is like a
[50:20] a third layer a tertiary layer
[50:23] so that is
[50:24] like that could be symbiotic with the
[50:26] cortex it&#39;d be much smarter than the
[50:28] cortex but you&#39;d essentially have three
[50:30] layers
[50:30] and you actually have that right now
[50:32] your phone is capable of things and your
[50:34] computer is capable things that your
[50:36] brain is definitely not
[50:38] you know storing
[50:40] your terabytes of information
[50:42] perfectly
[50:44] um
[50:45] doing
[50:46] incredible calculations that you you
[50:48] know we couldn&#39;t even come close to
[50:49] doing
[50:50] you have that with your computer
[50:53] it&#39;s just like i said the data rate is
[50:54] slow the connection is weak
[50:57] why is it so
[50:59] disconcerting or why is it why does it
[51:02] not give me comfort
[51:04] to think about like when i think about a
[51:06] symbiotic connection to ai i always
[51:08] think of this cold
[51:10] emotionless
[51:13] sort of
[51:14] thing that we will become
[51:16] is that a bad way to look at it i don&#39;t
[51:18] think that&#39;s not that&#39;s not quite that&#39;s
[51:19] not how it would be
[51:21] like i said you you already are yeah
[51:23] symbiotic with ai or computers phones
[51:27] computers laptops yeah and there&#39;s
[51:28] there&#39;s quite a bit of ai going on you
[51:30] know near so artificial neural nets
[51:33] um increasingly
[51:35] neural nets are
[51:38] sort of taking over from regular
[51:39] programming more and more
[51:42] so
[51:43] you are connected
[51:45] um
[51:47] you know
[51:48] if you use
[51:49] google voice or alexa or one of those
[51:51] things it&#39;s using a neural net to decode
[51:53] your speech and try to understand what
[51:54] you&#39;re saying
[51:56] um
[51:57] you know if if you&#39;re trying to image
[51:58] recognition or improve the quality of
[52:00] photograph it&#39;s
[52:02] it&#39;s using the neural nets the best way
[52:04] to do that so
[52:06] um you are already
[52:09] uh
[52:11] sort of a
[52:12] sort of a cybernetic symbiote
[52:14] it like said you
[52:16] when that
[52:17] it&#39;s just a question of your data rate
[52:19] the the the communication speed between
[52:22] your your phone and your brain is slow
[52:26] when do you think you&#39;re gonna do it
[52:29] how long will you wait um
[52:33] like once it starts becoming available
[52:35] yeah if it works i&#39;ll do it sure
[52:37] right away
[52:39] i mean let&#39;s make sure it works
[52:41] how do we make sure it works we&#39;re
[52:43] trying on prisoners like what do you do
[52:45] no no you take rapists no cut holes in
[52:48] your head
[52:48] now like i said if somebody&#39;s got a
[52:50] serious brain injury right um
[52:52] and though you know people have like
[52:53] very severe brain injuries um
[52:56] and then and then you can fix those
[52:58] those brain injuries um and
[53:02] you know then you prove out that it
[53:03] works and you expand envelope expand and
[53:07] make more and more brain injuries
[53:09] uh sold more and more um and that you
[53:12] know suddenly at certain age we all are
[53:14] are going to get alzheimer&#39;s we&#39;re all
[53:15] going to get senile um and then you know
[53:18] moms forget the names of their kids and
[53:20] that kind of thing and so
[53:21] you know
[53:22] it&#39;s like you said okay well you know
[53:24] this would allow you to
[53:26] remember your names your kids and and
[53:28] and have
[53:29] a normal a much more normal life where
[53:32] you you you&#39;re able to function much
[53:34] later in life
[53:36] um so i think that so essentially that
[53:38] there would almost everyone would find a
[53:40] need at some point if if you get old
[53:43] enough to
[53:44] use your neural link
[53:47] and
[53:48] and and then it&#39;s like okay so we can
[53:50] improve the functionality and improve
[53:52] the communications communication speed
[53:54] so
[53:55] then you
[53:56] will not have to use your thumbs to
[53:58] communicate with the computer
[54:02] do you ever sit down extrapolate do you
[54:03] ever like sit down and think about
[54:07] all the different iterations of this and
[54:09] what this eventually leads to
[54:13] um yeah i mean i think sure think about
[54:15] a lot um
[54:17] there&#39;s
[54:19] like i said this is not something that&#39;s
[54:20] going to sneak up on you you know
[54:22] there&#39;s like getting fda approval for
[54:23] this stuff is not like overnight you
[54:26] know um
[54:27] and
[54:30] this there&#39;s
[54:31] i mean we probably
[54:32] have to be on like version 10 or
[54:34] something
[54:35] before
[54:37] you know
[54:38] it it
[54:39] would realistically be
[54:43] um
[54:44] you know a human ai symbiote situation
[54:51] so you&#39;ll see it coming you know
[54:53] you see it coming but what do you think
[54:55] it&#39;s going to be
[54:56] like when you sit when you&#39;re alone if
[54:58] you have free time i don&#39;t know if you
[54:59] have free time but if you just sit down
[55:01] and think
[55:02] about
[55:03] this iteration the next onward keep
[55:06] going
[55:07] and you you drag it out with
[55:09] improvements along the way
[55:10] and leaps and bounds and technological
[55:12] innovations and
[55:14] where do you see it
[55:18] what are we going to be like when 20 25
[55:21] years from now what are we going to be
[55:30] well assuming civilization is still
[55:32] around um it&#39;s looking fragile right now
[55:36] um
[55:38] i think we i think we could have a
[55:43] in 25 years probably something i think
[55:45] like that could be a whole brain
[55:47] interface
[55:49] a whole brain interface
[55:51] sorry pretty close to that yeah how does
[55:53] how do you define what do you mean by
[55:54] whole brain interface
[55:57] um
[55:59] like almost all the neurons
[56:03] are connected to
[56:06] uh
[56:09] you&#39;re the sort of
[56:10] ai extension of yourself
[56:14] if you want ai extension of yourself
[56:18] yeah
[56:19] what does that mean to you like when you
[56:21] say ai extension of yourself
[56:25] well you like i said you already have
[56:28] a computer extension of yourself in your
[56:30] phone
[56:30] you know and computers and stuff so and
[56:33] now online it&#39;s like somebody dies
[56:35] there&#39;s this like an online ghost
[56:37] that they&#39;re they&#39;re still their online
[56:39] stuff yeah it&#39;s alive that&#39;s a good way
[56:42] to put it it is weird when you read
[56:43] someone&#39;s tweets after they&#39;re dead
[56:45] yeah yeah
[56:47] instagram and their stories and stuff
[56:48] yeah whatever facebook inside you know
[56:50] like that&#39;s a great way to put it it&#39;s
[56:52] like an online ghost
[56:54] that&#39;s very accurate
[56:56] yeah so
[57:00] yeah so there&#39;s
[57:03] it would just be that that more of you
[57:05] would be
[57:07] in the cloud i guess than in your body
[57:10] more of it more of you
[57:13] whoa
[57:16] now when you say civilization&#39;s fragile
[57:17] do you mean because of this covet 19
[57:19] [ __ ] that&#39;s going on right now what&#39;s
[57:21] that i&#39;ve never heard of it it&#39;s this
[57:22] thing yeah no it&#39;s like uh some people
[57:24] just get a card other people
[57:27] it gets much worse
[57:29] uh sure
[57:31] yeah
[57:33] well
[57:35] yeah
[57:39] i mean this certainly has taken over the
[57:41] mayan space of the world
[57:43] to a degree that is quite shocking yeah
[57:46] well out of nowhere that&#39;s what&#39;s crazy
[57:48] it&#39;s like
[57:49] you go back to november nothing now here
[57:52] we are december january february march
[57:54] april may six months
[57:56] totally different world
[57:58] so from nothing to everything&#39;s locked
[58:00] down
[58:01] there&#39;s so much uh conflicting
[58:04] information and conflicting opinions
[58:05] about how to proceed
[58:07] what what has happened
[58:09] you you find things where
[58:11] there was a meat packing plant i believe
[58:13] in missouri where
[58:16] 300 plus people were asymptomatic tested
[58:20] positive or asymptomatic and then in
[58:22] other places it just ravages entire
[58:24] communities and kills people and it&#39;s
[58:26] it&#39;s so weird it almost appears on the
[58:29] out like if you didn&#39;t know any better
[58:31] you&#39;d be like what it seems like there&#39;s
[58:32] a bunch of different viruses it doesn&#39;t
[58:34] seem like it&#39;s the same thing or has a
[58:37] bunch of different reactions to the
[58:39] biological variety of of people
[58:44] yeah um
[58:48] i mean i kind of saw this whole thing
[58:50] play out in china uh before it played
[58:52] out in the us
[58:54] so
[58:55] um it&#39;s kind of like watching the same
[58:57] movie again
[58:59] but in english
[59:02] um so
[59:06] yeah um
[59:11] i might i think the the the the
[59:13] mortality rate is much less than what is
[59:17] then what say the world health
[59:19] organization said it was it&#39;s very much
[59:21] module assets like probably at least
[59:22] order of magnitude less well it seems to
[59:25] be very deadly to very specific kinds of
[59:28] people and people with specific problems
[59:32] yeah i mean if you&#39;re
[59:35] you can look at the mortality statistics
[59:38] you know by age and whether they have
[59:40] comorbid comorbidities like do they have
[59:42] like basically existing conditions and
[59:44] um by age um and uh
[59:49] you know if you&#39;re
[59:51] below 60 and and have no serious health
[59:54] issues the probability of death is
[59:56] extremely low it&#39;s not zero but it&#39;s
[59:58] extremely low
[60:00] they didn&#39;t think that this was the case
[60:03] though when they first started to lock
[60:05] down the country do you think that it&#39;s
[60:07] a situation where once they&#39;ve proceeded
[60:10] in a certain way it&#39;s very difficult to
[60:12] correct course
[60:18] it&#39;s almost like people really wanted
[60:20] a panic
[60:21] that you know
[60:23] quite quite crazy
[60:25] but in some places a panic is deserved
[60:27] right like if you&#39;re in the icu in
[60:29] manhattan and people are dying left and
[60:31] right and everyone&#39;s on intubators and
[60:33] it&#39;s
[60:34] it&#39;s it seems like
[60:36] when you see all these people on
[60:38] ventilators and so many of them are
[60:40] dying and you see these nurses are dying
[60:42] and doctors are getting sick
[60:44] in some places
[60:45] that
[60:46] fear is justified but then in other
[60:48] places
[60:50] you&#39;re reading these stories about
[60:51] hospitals that are
[60:53] essentially half empty
[60:55] they&#39;re they&#39;re having to furlough
[60:56] doctors and nurses because there&#39;s no
[60:59] work for them
[61:00] most of the hospitals in the united
[61:02] states right now half empty
[61:04] in some cases they&#39;re at 30 capacity
[61:06] and is this because they&#39;ve decided to
[61:09] forego elective procedures
[61:11] and and normal things that people would
[61:14] have to go to the hospital for
[61:16] yes i mean
[61:18] we&#39;re not talking about just
[61:20] some of these elective procedures are
[61:21] quite important like it&#39;s like you have
[61:23] about a lot of disease yeah sure and you
[61:25] need a you know triple bypass it&#39;s like
[61:29] sort of elective but if you don&#39;t get it
[61:31] done in time it&#39;s you&#39;re gonna die yeah
[61:33] it&#39;s elective is a weird word yeah
[61:35] elective it&#39;s not like hey i i want to
[61:38] it&#39;s not like plastic surgery
[61:42] it&#39;s more like like my my hip is i&#39;m in
[61:44] extreme pain because my my hips blown
[61:47] out or my knee and i
[61:48] don&#39;t want to go to the hospital i can&#39;t
[61:50] go to the hospital to you know people in
[61:52] extreme pain
[61:53] people that need a kidney you know like
[61:55] people that have like quite serious
[61:57] issues that are choosing not to go out
[61:59] of fear um so i think it&#39;s
[62:01] it&#39;s a problem it&#39;s not good it seems
[62:03] like the state of public perception is
[62:05] shifting it is like people are taking
[62:08] some deep breaths and relaxing and
[62:10] because of the statistics of i mean and
[62:13] essentially across the board it&#39;s being
[62:15] recognized that it&#39;s not
[62:18] as fatal as we thought it was still
[62:20] dangerous still worse than the flu but
[62:22] not as bad
[62:24] as we thought or we feared it could be
[62:28] i mean objectively the mortality is is
[62:31] much lower
[62:32] like
[62:34] at least a factor of 10
[62:36] maybe a factor of 50 lower than
[62:38] initially thought
[62:41] do you think that the current way we&#39;re
[62:44] handling this
[62:45] the social distancing the mass the
[62:47] locking down is it does this make sense
[62:50] is it adequate or do you think that we
[62:53] should
[62:54] move back to
[62:56] at least closer to where we used to be
[63:00] well i think proper hygiene is a good
[63:02] thing no matter what you know wash your
[63:03] hands and
[63:05] you know and if you&#39;re
[63:06] if you&#39;re coughing stay home or wear a
[63:09] mask this is not good you know um like
[63:12] they do that in japan that&#39;s like normal
[63:13] if you&#39;re if you&#39;re ill you you wear a
[63:16] face mask and you don&#39;t cough on people
[63:18] i think that that would be a great thing
[63:20] to to adopt in general throughout the
[63:22] world
[63:23] um
[63:25] washing your hands is
[63:26] also good well that&#39;s the speculation
[63:28] why men get it more than women because
[63:30] men are disgusting and we don&#39;t watch
[63:31] that disgusting it&#39;s true it&#39;s true yeah
[63:34] we&#39;re all my men in this room we&#39;re all
[63:36] gross yeah let&#39;s go to the restroom you
[63:37] can see us yes we&#39;re gross my daughter
[63:39] my nine-year-old daughter yells at me
[63:41] she goes did you wash your hands she
[63:43] makes me go back and wash my hands hmm
[63:45] she&#39;s right
[63:46] nine years old if i had a nine-year-old
[63:48] boy do you think he would care i
[63:49] wouldn&#39;t give a [ __ ] if i wash my hands
[63:52] true
[63:53] um
[63:54] so yeah i think that there&#39;s definitely
[63:56] some silver linings here
[63:58] than in improved uh
[63:59] you know uh hygiene yeah and an
[64:02] awareness of potential yes and i think
[64:04] this has shaken up the the system uh
[64:07] system is like somewhat more bond with
[64:09] la la&#39;s layers of bureaucracy and i
[64:12] think that we&#39;ve cut through some of
[64:13] that bureaucracy
[64:14] uh and
[64:16] if we you know at some point there
[64:17] probably will be a
[64:19] uh
[64:21] pandemic with with a with a high
[64:23] mortality rate uh
[64:26] debate about like what&#39;s high but i mean
[64:28] like someone that&#39;s killing a lot of 20
[64:30] year olds let&#39;s say like it&#39;s
[64:32] yeah if you had like ebola type of
[64:34] mortality spanish flu something that uh
[64:36] tax immune systems of healthy people
[64:38] yeah yeah um yeah but it&#39;s a
[64:42] yeah like like killing large numbers of
[64:45] young healthy people that that&#39;s
[64:47] you know
[64:48] define that as like uh
[64:50] uh
[64:52] high mortality then that this is at
[64:54] least practice for something like that
[64:56] um and i think there&#39;s
[64:58] this you know
[64:59] given it&#39;s just a matter of time that
[65:01] there will be eventually some
[65:03] some such pandemic
[65:05] do you think that in a sense the one
[65:08] good thing that we might get out of this
[65:09] is the realization that this is a
[65:10] potential reality that we we got lucky
[65:13] in this sense i mean in people that
[65:15] didn&#39;t get lucky and died of course i&#39;m
[65:17] not disrespecting their death and their
[65:19] loss but i&#39;m saying overall as a as a
[65:21] culture as a community as a human race
[65:23] as a community
[65:24] this is not as bad as it could have been
[65:26] this is a good dry run for us to
[65:28] appreciate
[65:30] that we need far more resources
[65:33] dedicated towards the the understanding
[65:37] these diseases
[65:38] what to do in the case of pandemic and
[65:40] much more
[65:42] money that goes to funding
[65:44] treatments and and some preventative
[65:46] measures
[65:48] yeah absolutely um
[65:50] and i think i think there&#39;s a
[65:52] good chance it&#39;s highly likely i think
[65:54] coming out of this that
[65:56] we will develop uh vaccines that we
[65:59] didn&#39;t have before
[66:01] uh for uh
[66:03] quran viruses and other other viruses um
[66:06] and and possibly cures uh for for these
[66:09] and our understanding of
[66:11] uh viruses of this nature has improved
[66:13] dramatically because of the attention
[66:15] that it&#39;s received
[66:17] so
[66:18] there&#39;s definitely some you know a lot
[66:20] of silver linings here um
[66:23] and potentially if we act correctly
[66:26] yeah yeah yeah there&#39;s uh i think
[66:29] there will be some amounts of lighting
[66:31] here no matter what um hopefully it can
[66:33] be more professive lighting than less
[66:35] yeah
[66:36] um
[66:38] so yeah this is this is uh
[66:41] it&#39;s like kind of like a practice run
[66:42] for something that had that that had a
[66:45] potential that might in the future have
[66:46] a serious uh like a really high
[66:49] mortality rate that
[66:50] and we
[66:52] kind of got to go through this with
[66:54] without without it being something that
[66:56] kills you know vast numbers of
[66:58] young healthy people
[66:59] yeah
[67:00] when you made a series of tweets
[67:03] recently uh you know uh i don&#39;t remember
[67:05] the exact wording but essentially you
[67:06] were saying free america now like let&#39;s
[67:09] think about that is it thank you
[67:11] but uh the the you know what was the
[67:14] how much do you pay attention to the
[67:16] response to that stuff and what was the
[67:18] response like
[67:19] did anybody go hey elon what the [ __ ]
[67:21] you doing did anybody pull you aside
[67:24] who does that who gets to do that to you
[67:28] well i mean i certainly get that there&#39;s
[67:30] no shortage of negative feedback on
[67:32] twitter you know oh yeah twitter
[67:35] yeah but i don&#39;t read that do you read
[67:37] it warzone you do sometimes though right
[67:39] you do read it yeah i mean
[67:41] scroll through the comments like as a
[67:43] meme warzone
[67:45] yeah i mean people knife you&#39;re good
[67:48] it&#39;s something i i enjoy about
[67:51] that just the
[67:53] there&#39;s a
[67:55] something about the
[67:58] the freedom of expression that comes
[68:00] from all these people that do attack you
[68:03] it&#39;s like well they if there was no
[68:05] vulnerability whatsoever they wouldn&#39;t
[68:07] attack you and
[68:08] it&#39;s like there&#39;s something about these
[68:12] millions and millions of perspectives
[68:15] that you you have to
[68:17] you have to appreciate
[68:19] even if it comes your way even if the
[68:21] [ __ ] storm hits you in the face sure you
[68:23] gotta appreciate wow how amazing is it
[68:26] that all these people do have the
[68:27] ability to express themselves
[68:29] you don&#39;t don&#39;t necessarily want to be
[68:30] there when the [ __ ] hits you sure you
[68:33] might want to get out of the way in
[68:34] anticipation of the [ __ ] storm but the
[68:36] fact that so many people have the
[68:38] ability to reach out and i think it&#39;s in
[68:40] a lot of ways it&#39;s uh i don&#39;t wanna say
[68:42] a misused resource but it&#39;s like giving
[68:46] monkeys guns they just start
[68:48] they start gunning down
[68:50] things that in front of them without any
[68:51] realization of what they&#39;re doing they
[68:54] have a rock they see a window they throw
[68:56] it whoa look at that i got elon madd
[68:59] look at that this guy got mad at me this
[69:01] this i i [ __ ] took this person down
[69:03] on twitter i got this lady fired oh the
[69:06] [ __ ] business is going under because
[69:08] of twitter wars it seems like there&#39;s
[69:11] something about it that&#39;s this
[69:13] newfound
[69:14] thing
[69:16] that uh i want to say abuse but just i
[69:19] want to say that it&#39;s almost like you
[69:21] know you hit the button and things blow
[69:22] up you&#39;re like wow
[69:24] this is what else can we blow up
[69:28] sure
[69:28] um
[69:31] i mean i&#39;ve been in the twitter war zone
[69:32] for for a while here so put your war
[69:34] zone
[69:36] you know take it takes a lot to phase me
[69:38] at this point yeah that&#39;s good too right
[69:40] like you develop a thick skin
[69:43] yeah you can&#39;t take it personally these
[69:45] people don&#39;t like actually know you you
[69:47] know like yeah
[69:49] it&#39;s just like
[69:50] you know so it&#39;s like if you&#39;re if
[69:51] you&#39;re fighting a war
[69:53] and there&#39;s like some opposing soldier
[69:55] that that shoots shoots at you it&#39;s not
[69:58] like they hate you they don&#39;t even know
[69:59] you right yeah yeah so
[70:02] just think of it like that like they&#39;re
[70:03] firing bullets or whatever um but they
[70:06] don&#39;t know you so don&#39;t take it
[70:07] personally there&#39;s something interesting
[70:09] about it too it&#39;s like uh like when you
[70:11] write something in you know 280
[70:14] characters and they write something into
[70:15] it it&#39;s such a crude way
[70:17] it&#39;s like you know someone&#39;s saying
[70:19] sending opposing smoke signals that
[70:21] refute your smoke signals it&#39;s like
[70:23] it&#39;s so crude
[70:26] and especially when you&#39;re talking about
[70:27] something like neural link he&#39;s talking
[70:29] about some future potential where you&#39;re
[70:32] going to be able to express pure
[70:33] thoughts that get get conveyed through
[70:36] some sort of a universal language with
[70:39] no ambiguity whatsoever
[70:41] versus
[70:43] you know tweets
[70:45] well there&#39;ll always be some ambiguity
[70:46] but yeah
[70:47] tweets are
[70:49] it&#39;s hard um
[70:51] like the maybe there should be like a
[70:52] sarcasm flag or something you know right
[70:54] right um or i&#39;m not you know just
[70:57] kidding or whatever you know like don&#39;t
[70:58] you know it seems like it would take
[71:00] away some of the fun from people that
[71:02] know it&#39;s sarcasm like if everybody knew
[71:04] that the onion wasn&#39;t real if you sent
[71:06] people articles yeah is something about
[71:09] someone getting angry at an onion
[71:11] article wow that&#39;s amazing you know what
[71:13] i mean where they don&#39;t realize what it
[71:15] is there&#39;s something fun about that for
[71:16] everybody else
[71:18] uh yeah
[71:19] i know it&#39;s pretty great
[71:21] it might be the best news source
[71:23] do you know who titania mcgrath is
[71:26] hilario it&#39;s uh andrew boyle he&#39;s a uh a
[71:30] british fellow a brilliant guy who&#39;s
[71:32] been on the podcast before and he has
[71:33] this uh fictional character this uh
[71:36] pseudonym titania mcgrath who&#39;s like
[71:38] this all the ultimate social justice
[71:40] warrior
[71:42] is this like
[71:43] like a female avatar
[71:45] a female avatar that&#39;s actually a
[71:47] computer conglomeration of a bunch of
[71:49] faces okay it&#39;s not really one person so
[71:51] one person can&#39;t be a victim and be
[71:53] angry he&#39;s sort of combined these faces
[71:55] to make this one perfect social justice
[71:57] more okay but the thing like i
[71:59] recognized it early on before i met him
[72:02] sure that this was parody this is this
[72:05] was just fun
[72:06] and then i love reading the people that
[72:09] don&#39;t recognize that they get angry sure
[72:12] and then they&#39;re really really like
[72:14] there&#39;s a lot of people that just get
[72:16] really furious sure about some of
[72:19] some fun to that
[72:21] there&#39;s some fun to the not picking up
[72:24] on the the the true nature of the signal
[72:28] i find twitter quite engaging
[72:31] how do you have the time
[72:33] um well i mean it&#39;s like
[72:36] five minutes every couple hours type of
[72:38] thing it&#39;s not like i&#39;m sitting on an
[72:40] old day but even five minutes every
[72:41] couple hours if those are bad five
[72:44] minutes they might be bouncing around
[72:45] your head for the next 30.
[72:48] yeah you have to
[72:50] you know like i said
[72:52] take a certain amount of
[72:53] distance from you read this and you&#39;re
[72:54] like okay it&#39;s bullets being fired by an
[72:57] opposing army
[72:59] you know don&#39;t like it
[73:00] it&#39;s not like they they like so it&#39;s not
[73:02] like they know you it&#39;s like
[73:04] don&#39;t take it personally um did you feel
[73:06] the same way when when cnn
[73:08] had that stupid [ __ ] about ventilators
[73:10] with you
[73:11] i i found that
[73:12] both confusing and the the the
[73:15] yeah that was annoying it was annoying
[73:18] but what is also annoying as a person
[73:19] who reads
[73:21] cnn and wants to think of them as a
[73:23] responsible conveyor of the facts
[73:26] i would like to think that
[73:28] yeah
[73:30] i don&#39;t think cnn is that i think he
[73:32] used to be he used to be yeah
[73:34] um like what do you think&#39;s the the best
[73:36] source of just like information out
[73:38] there that&#39;s a good question you know
[73:39] like
[73:40] let&#39;s say you&#39;re just like
[73:42] average citizen trying to just get the
[73:44] facts you know figure out what&#39;s going
[73:46] on like you know how to
[73:48] live your life and
[73:50] you know just looking for
[73:51] what what&#39;s going on in the world that
[73:53] it&#39;s hard to find something that that
[73:55] isn&#39;t
[73:57] you know
[73:59] that&#39;s that that&#39;s good yeah you know uh
[74:02] that you know not not trying to push
[74:04] some partisan angle not trying to not
[74:07] not sort of doing sloppy reporting and
[74:09] and just aiming for the most number of
[74:11] clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars
[74:13] and that kind of thing yeah
[74:15] you&#39;re just trying to figure out what&#39;s
[74:16] going on it&#39;s like
[74:17] i&#39;m hard pressed
[74:20] where do you go i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t
[74:22] think there&#39;s any pure form
[74:24] my favorite
[74:26] places are the new york times and the la
[74:28] times and i don&#39;t trust them 100 percent
[74:31] you know because also there&#39;s
[74:33] individuals that are writing these
[74:35] stories
[74:36] exactly and that&#39;s seems to be the
[74:37] problems these individual biases and
[74:39] these individual
[74:41] there&#39;s
[74:42] purposely distorted perceptions and then
[74:44] there&#39;s ignorantly
[74:46] reported facts and there&#39;s so many
[74:49] variables and you got to put everything
[74:51] through this filter of where is this
[74:53] person coming from do they have
[74:54] political biases do they have social
[74:56] biases do they are they
[74:59] are they upset because of their own
[75:00] shortcomings and they are they
[75:02] projecting this into the story sure it&#39;s
[75:04] so hard
[75:06] yeah i think like maybe just trying to
[75:07] find individual reporters that you think
[75:09] are good and yeah kind of falling down
[75:11] as opposed to the publication i go with
[75:13] whatever matt taibbi says
[75:15] okay i trust him more than anybody all
[75:17] right
[75:18] matt taib he&#39;s onto something i just
[75:20] he&#39;s as far as investigative reporters
[75:22] in particular the way he reported the
[75:24] savings and loan crisis the way he
[75:26] reports everything i just i just listen
[75:28] to him above
[75:30] most
[75:31] above mo he&#39;s my go-to guy all right
[75:33] i&#39;ll check it out uh it&#39;s rolling
[75:35] stone&#39;s articles or his stuff on the
[75:36] savings alone crisis just like what in
[75:38] the [ __ ]
[75:39] and you know and he wasn&#39;t you know he&#39;s
[75:41] not an economist by any stretch of the
[75:42] imagination so he had to really sort of
[75:44] deeply embed himself in that world to
[75:46] try to understand it and to be able to
[75:48] report on it
[75:50] and was also with a humorous flair
[75:52] for now that&#39;s nice yeah um
[75:56] yeah
[75:57] but it&#39;s not that many of them there&#39;s
[76:00] it&#39;s hard and not a location where like
[76:03] we are no [ __ ] that&#39;s right you know
[76:05] we are no bullshit.com like the one
[76:07] place where you can say this is what we
[76:10] know this is what we don&#39;t know this is
[76:11] what we think not
[76:13] this person&#39;s wrong and here&#39;s why like
[76:15] oh
[76:16] god damn it you know i can&#39;t you you
[76:19] don&#39;t know there&#39;s a lot of stuff that
[76:21] is open to interpretation
[76:23] yeah
[76:24] this this particular coronavirus issue
[76:26] that we&#39;re dealing with right now seems
[76:27] to be a great
[76:30] illuminator of that very fact is that
[76:33] there&#39;s so much
[76:34] data and there&#39;s this so there&#39;s so much
[76:37] that&#39;s open to interpret there&#39;s so many
[76:38] thing because it&#39;s all happening in real
[76:40] time right and like particularly right
[76:42] now in california we&#39;re in stage two
[76:45] tomorrow or friday two days from now
[76:47] stage two retail stores opening up
[76:49] things are changing like when no one
[76:51] knows the correct
[76:54] process that needs to take place to save
[76:56] the most amount of lives but yet ensure
[76:59] that our
[77:00] our culture and that our
[77:02] our our economy survives
[77:05] it&#39;s a lot of speculation and guessing
[77:07] but if you go to certain places they&#39;ll
[77:09] tell you we know why and we know this
[77:12] and we know uh
[77:13] it&#39;s hard
[77:15] yeah i mean
[77:17] i
[77:18] in general i think that&#39;s like we should
[77:20] be concerned about
[77:22] um anything that&#39;s a massive
[77:23] infringement on our civil civil
[77:25] liberties yes you know so it&#39;s like
[77:28] you got to put a lot of weight on that
[77:30] um
[77:31] you know people
[77:32] a lot of people died to
[77:33] you know win independence with the
[77:35] country and and fight for the democracy
[77:37] that we have and uh
[77:40] you know we should treasure that and not
[77:42] and not give up our liberties too easily
[77:44] i think we&#39;ve we
[77:45] i mean i think we probably did that
[77:47] actually
[77:48] well i like what you said when you said
[77:50] that it should be a choice
[77:52] and that
[77:54] to require people to stay home require
[77:57] people to not go to work require and to
[78:00] to arrest people for trying to make a
[78:03] living this all seems wrong and i think
[78:05] it&#39;s a wrong approach it&#39;s a it&#39;s uh
[78:08] you&#39;re you&#39;re
[78:09] it&#39;s an infantilization
[78:11] of the society
[78:13] that daddy&#39;s going to tell you what to
[78:14] do fundamentally a violation of the
[78:16] constitution yeah freedom of assembly
[78:18] and you know it&#39;s just
[78:21] i mean i don&#39;t think these things stand
[78:22] up in court really they&#39;re arresting
[78:24] people for protesting yeah yeah because
[78:27] they&#39;re protesting and violating social
[78:29] distancing and these mandates that tell
[78:31] people that they have to stay home
[78:33] yeah these these are these would
[78:34] definitely not stand up uh you know if
[78:37] the
[78:38] supreme court here i mean it&#39;s obviously
[78:40] a complete violation right yeah yeah and
[78:42] again this is not
[78:43] in any way um disrespecting the people
[78:46] who have died from this disease that&#39;s
[78:48] certainly a real thing to think of
[78:50] yeah i mean it it it just should be if
[78:53] if you&#39;re if you&#39;re at risk you should
[78:55] not be compelled to leave your house
[78:57] right um or leave a place of safety but
[78:59] you should also not be
[79:00] uh if you&#39;re not at risk or if you are
[79:03] at risk and you wish to take a risk with
[79:05] your life you should have the right to
[79:06] do that and it seems like at this point
[79:09] in time particularly
[79:10] our resources would be best served
[79:13] protecting the people that are at risk
[79:16] versus penalizing the people that are
[79:18] not at high risk for living their life
[79:20] the way they did particularly having a
[79:22] career and and making a living and
[79:24] feeding your family
[79:26] paying your bills keeping your store
[79:27] open keeping your restaurant open
[79:30] yes
[79:31] i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a strong a strong
[79:33] downside to this yeah
[79:35] so
[79:37] yeah i just believe like you know if
[79:39] this is a free country you should be
[79:41] you know a lot allowed to do
[79:44] you know what you want as long as it
[79:45] does not endanger others but that&#39;s the
[79:47] thing right people this is the argument
[79:49] they will bring up like you are
[79:50] endangering others you should stay home
[79:53] for the people that that
[79:55] you even if you&#39;re fine even if you know
[79:57] you&#39;re gonna be okay there&#39;s certain
[79:58] people that will not be okay because of
[80:00] your actions they might get exposed to
[80:02] this thing that we don&#39;t have a vaccine
[80:04] for
[80:05] we don&#39;t have universally accepted
[80:07] treatment for
[80:09] and then we need to ca this is there&#39;s
[80:11] two arguments right the one argument is
[80:13] we need to keep going protect the weak
[80:15] protect the sick but let&#39;s open up the
[80:17] economy the other argument is stop
[80:20] placing money over human lives
[80:22] and let&#39;s shelter in place until we come
[80:25] up with some sort of a decision and
[80:27] let&#39;s figure out some way to develop
[80:30] some sort of universal income universal
[80:32] basic income plan or something like that
[80:34] to feed people during the during this
[80:36] time
[80:38] when we make this transition i think
[80:39] there&#39;s a
[80:41] yeah um
[80:43] as i said right
[80:45] yeah my opinion is if if somebody wants
[80:47] to stay home they should stay home and
[80:49] say something doesn&#39;t want to stay home
[80:50] they should not be compelled to stay
[80:51] home
[80:52] that&#39;s my opinion do you think
[80:54] if somebody doesn&#39;t like that well
[80:56] that&#39;s my opinion
[80:57] um
[80:58] so
[80:59] the now yeah um
[81:01] the the this notion though that uh you
[81:04] know you can just sort of send checks
[81:05] out everybody and and things will be
[81:06] fine it&#39;s not true obviously um the
[81:09] there&#39;s some people have this absurd
[81:12] like a
[81:13] view that the economy is like some magic
[81:16] horn of plenty
[81:18] like it it just makes stuff
[81:21] stuff you know whatever it just there&#39;s
[81:22] a magic quarter plenty and the goods and
[81:25] services they just come from this magic
[81:26] corner plenty and then if um like if
[81:29] somebody has more stuff than somebody
[81:31] else&#39;s because they took more from this
[81:32] magic corner plenty now let me uh just
[81:35] break it to uh
[81:37] the fools out there
[81:38] if you don&#39;t make stuff
[81:40] there&#39;s no stuff
[81:45] yeah
[81:45] so
[81:47] if you don&#39;t make the food if you don&#39;t
[81:49] process the food you know transport the
[81:51] food
[81:53] and what the
[81:54] whether you know medical treatment
[81:57] getting getting your teeth fixed
[82:01] there&#39;s no stuff
[82:04] i become detached from reality
[82:09] you can&#39;t just
[82:10] legislate
[82:11] money and solve these things if you
[82:13] don&#39;t make stuff there is no stuff
[82:18] obviously
[82:20] we&#39;ll run out of the stores
[82:22] run out of the you know
[82:25] it&#39;s the whole the machine just grinds
[82:27] to a halt
[82:28] but the the initial thought on this
[82:31] virus the real fear was that this was
[82:33] going to kill
[82:34] hundreds of thousands if not millions of
[82:37] people instantaneously
[82:39] in this country it was going to do it
[82:41] very quickly if we didn&#39;t hunker down if
[82:43] we didn&#39;t shelter in place if we didn&#39;t
[82:45] quarantine ourselves or lock down
[82:48] do you think that the initial thought
[82:50] was a good idea based on the perception
[82:52] that this was going to be far more
[82:54] deadly than it turned out to be
[83:00] maybe i think
[83:01] briefly briefly briefly
[83:05] but uh i think if you know any any kind
[83:07] of like sensible examination of what
[83:09] happened in china would lead to the
[83:10] conclusion that that is obviously not
[83:12] going to occur uh this this virus
[83:14] originated in wuhan there&#39;s like i don&#39;t
[83:16] know hundred thousand people a day
[83:17] leaving on uh so it that that it it uh
[83:21] it went everywhere very fast
[83:25] through throughout china throughout the
[83:26] rest of the world
[83:27] um and
[83:31] the fatality rate was
[83:33] was low don&#39;t you think though it&#39;s
[83:34] difficult to appreciate it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
[83:37] difficult to filter
[83:39] what the information is coming out of
[83:40] china
[83:41] to accurately
[83:44] really get a real true representation of
[83:46] what happened the the propaganda machine
[83:48] is very strong sure what
[83:51] the world health organization appears to
[83:53] have been complicit
[83:55] with a lot of their propaganda
[83:57] the thing is that
[83:59] american companies have massive
[84:01] supply chains in china like tesla for
[84:04] example we have hundreds of suppliers
[84:06] like tier one two three four suppliers
[84:08] throughout throughout china so
[84:11] we know if they are able to make stuff
[84:12] or not
[84:14] we know if they if they have issues or
[84:15] not
[84:16] then they they&#39;re china is back back at
[84:18] full steam
[84:20] um and until
[84:22] many
[84:24] uh pretty much every u.s company has
[84:27] some significant number of flies in
[84:28] china so you know you know if they&#39;re
[84:30] able to
[84:31] you know
[84:33] provide things or not or if there&#39;s
[84:36] you know
[84:38] high mortality rate
[84:39] tesla has seven thousand people in china
[84:42] so
[84:44] zero people died
[84:45] um zero
[84:48] okay so that that&#39;s a real statistic
[84:50] that&#39;s coming from yeah yeah you know
[84:52] those people yeah we literally we&#39;re in
[84:55] payroll do you think there&#39;s a danger of
[84:56] this
[84:59] same folks are there yeah
[85:01] do you think there&#39;s a danger of
[85:02] politicizing this whereas becomes like
[85:04] opening up the country&#39;s uh donald
[85:06] trump&#39;s
[85:07] it&#39;s his goal it&#39;s his and then
[85:10] anything he does is sort of uh there&#39;s
[85:12] there&#39;s people that are going to oppose
[85:14] it and come up with some reasons why
[85:16] he&#39;s wrong particularly in this climate
[85:17] whereas as we&#39;re leading up november
[85:20] and you know the the 2020 elections do
[85:23] you think that this is a real danger in
[85:25] terms of uh public&#39;s perception that
[85:27] trump wants to open it up so they
[85:29] knee-jerk
[85:30] oppose it because they oppose trump
[85:34] i i think there has been some
[85:36] politician this has been
[85:38] politicized
[85:40] you know
[85:41] in both directions really so it&#39;s
[85:44] um
[85:45] which is
[85:47] not great
[85:53] yeah but like i said separate apart from
[85:54] that i think there&#39;s the question of
[85:56] like
[85:56] you know where do several civil
[85:58] liberties fit in this picture you know
[86:00] yeah and uh what what what can the
[86:02] government make you do what can they
[86:04] make you not do and what you know what&#39;s
[86:06] what&#39;s okay right um
[86:09] and uh
[86:13] yeah i think we went too far
[86:15] do you think it&#39;s one of those things
[86:16] where once
[86:18] we&#39;ve gone in a certain direction it&#39;s
[86:20] very difficult to make a correction
[86:23] make a an adjustment to to realize like
[86:25] okay we thought it was one thing it&#39;s
[86:28] not it&#39;s not good but it&#39;s not what we
[86:30] thought it was going to be it&#39;s not what
[86:31] we feared so let&#39;s let&#39;s back up and
[86:34] reconsider let&#39;s do this publicly and
[86:36] say we were acting
[86:38] based on the information that we had
[86:40] initially that information appears to be
[86:42] faulty
[86:43] and uh here&#39;s how we move forward while
[86:46] protecting civil liberties while
[86:48] protecting what essentially this country
[86:51] was founded on which is a very agreed
[86:54] upon amount of freedom yeah that we
[86:55] respect and appreciate
[86:58] absolutely
[86:59] well i think we&#39;re we&#39;re rapidly moving
[87:00] towards opening up the country um it&#39;s
[87:03] going to happen extremely fast over the
[87:05] next few weeks
[87:08] so
[87:09] yeah
[87:12] something that would be helpful just add
[87:14] from an informational level is
[87:17] um when reporting uh
[87:20] sort of
[87:21] covet cases to separate out
[87:23] diagnosed with covert versus uh had
[87:26] covert like symptoms yes
[87:29] because the list of symptoms that could
[87:31] be covered at this point is like a mile
[87:33] long so it&#39;s like a hard to
[87:36] if you&#39;re ill at all it&#39;s like it could
[87:37] be covered so
[87:39] just just to give people better
[87:40] information
[87:41] definitely diagnosed with covert or
[87:44] had covered like symptoms we&#39;re
[87:46] conflating those two
[87:48] so that one that it looks bigger than it
[87:50] is
[87:50] then uh if somebody dies is
[87:53] was covert a a primary cause
[87:56] of the death or not
[87:58] uh i mean if i mean if somebody has kova
[88:01] gets eaten by a shark
[88:03] we find their arm their arm has covered
[88:07] it&#39;s gonna get recorded as a cover death
[88:09] is that real
[88:11] basically not that bad but heart attacks
[88:14] strokes you get hit by a bug cancer
[88:17] if you if you get hit by a bus
[88:18] go to the go to the hospital and die and
[88:21] then find that you have covered you will
[88:23] be recorded as a cover death why would
[88:24] they do that though
[88:27] well right now the so
[88:30] you know the road is hell is the rotel
[88:32] is paid with good intentions i mean he&#39;s
[88:33] mostly paid with bad intentions but
[88:34] there&#39;s you know some good intentions
[88:36] saving stones in there too
[88:38] um
[88:39] and the
[88:40] the the stimulus bill that was intended
[88:42] to help uh
[88:44] with the hospitals that were being
[88:46] overrun with with with code patients uh
[88:48] created an incentive to
[88:51] record something as covet that is
[88:55] difficult to
[88:56] say no to especially if your hospital is
[88:58] going bankrupt for lack of other
[88:59] patients
[89:00] so the hospitals are in a bind right now
[89:03] there&#39;s a bunch of hospitals are they&#39;re
[89:05] following doctors as you were mentioning
[89:06] they&#39;re
[89:08] you know they&#39;re your is half full
[89:09] you&#39;re
[89:10] it&#39;s hard hard to make ends meet
[89:12] so now you&#39;ve got like
[89:14] you know if i just check this box i get
[89:16] eight thousand dollars
[89:17] put on a ventilator for five minutes i
[89:19] get thirty nine thousand dollars
[89:21] back or or i to fire some doctors so
[89:24] what&#39;s the what&#39;s this this is a tough
[89:26] moral quandary
[89:27] it&#39;s like what you can do
[89:32] that&#39;s the situation we have
[89:33] no
[89:36] what what&#39;s the way out of this what do
[89:38] you think is like if if you had the
[89:40] president&#39;s ear or if people wanted to
[89:42] just listen to you openly
[89:44] what do you think is the way out of this
[89:46] so let&#39;s let&#39;s clear up the data clear
[89:48] up the data so
[89:50] like i said uh something should be
[89:51] required as code but only if it is uh
[89:53] somebody has been tested uh
[89:55] has received a positive positive cover
[89:57] test not if they simply have symptoms
[89:59] one of like 100 symptoms and then if
[90:03] if it is a cover death it must be
[90:05] separated or was this was coveted a
[90:06] primary primary reason for death or did
[90:08] they also have stage three cancer heart
[90:10] disease emphysema
[90:12] and got hit by a bus
[90:14] and had covered
[90:16] yeah i&#39;ve read all this stuff about that
[90:18] about them uh
[90:20] diagnosing people as a covet death
[90:22] despite other variables this is not a
[90:25] this is not a this is not a a
[90:28] question this is what is occurring
[90:30] and where are you reading this from
[90:32] where are you getting this from the
[90:34] public health health officials have
[90:35] literally said this
[90:37] this is not this is not a question mark
[90:39] right but this is never this is
[90:41] unprecedented right like if someone had
[90:43] the flu but also had a heart attack they
[90:45] would assume that that person died of a
[90:46] heart attack yes yeah so this is
[90:49] unprecedented is this because
[90:51] this is such a a popular i don&#39;t i don&#39;t
[90:54] want to use that word the wrong way but
[90:55] that&#39;s what i mean a popular subject
[90:59] and financial incentives yes
[91:03] and like so this is not some sort of it
[91:05] a moral indictment of of sort of
[91:07] hospital administrators it&#39;s just
[91:09] they&#39;re in it they&#39;re
[91:10] they&#39;re in a in a tough
[91:13] in a tough spot here
[91:14] um they actually don&#39;t have enough
[91:16] patience
[91:17] to
[91:18] to pay everyone for it to with without
[91:20] following following doctors and and
[91:22] firing staff and yeah they&#39;re running
[91:25] potentially going bankrupt so
[91:27] so then they&#39;re like okay well the
[91:29] stimulus bill says if you know we get
[91:31] all this
[91:32] you know money if we say
[91:35] if if they if it&#39;s a cover death i&#39;m
[91:37] like okay
[91:38] they coughed before they died
[91:41] in fact they&#39;re not even diagnosed with
[91:42] cover they simply if you had weakness a
[91:45] cough
[91:46] uh shortness of breath but frankly i&#39;m
[91:48] not sure how you die without those
[91:49] things
[91:51] yeah you yeah but there&#39;s so many
[91:54] different
[91:55] things that you could attribute to covet
[91:57] too there&#39;s so many symptoms
[91:59] there&#39;s diarrhea headaches dehydration
[92:02] yeah cough
[92:03] yes but to be clear you you don&#39;t even
[92:05] need to have gotten a cover diagram
[92:09] you simply need to have had one of many
[92:12] symptoms
[92:13] and then have died for some reason
[92:16] and it&#39;s
[92:17] covered
[92:19] so then it makes the death count look
[92:21] very high
[92:22] and then we&#39;re then stuck in a bind
[92:24] because it looks like the death count&#39;s
[92:25] super high and not going down like it
[92:27] should be
[92:28] and now
[92:30] so then we we should keep whatever
[92:32] you know
[92:36] keep you know the shelter in place stuff
[92:39] there and and keep people in their home
[92:40] you know confined people to homes so we
[92:43] need to break out of this this we&#39;re
[92:44] stuck in a loop yeah
[92:47] and i think the way to break out of this
[92:48] loop is to have clarity of information
[92:51] clarity of information will certainly
[92:53] help but
[92:54] altering perceptions public perception
[92:57] from people that are basically in a
[92:59] panic there&#39;s a lot of essentially
[93:01] well
[93:02] at least a month ago we&#39;re clearly in a
[93:05] panic i mean right where you know when
[93:07] you look around april 5th
[93:09] april 6th people were really freaking
[93:11] out but here we are may
[93:13] and may people are relaxing a little bit
[93:17] yes they&#39;re realizing like hey um i
[93:19] actually know a couple of people that
[93:20] got it it was just a cough and i know
[93:22] some people that got it where nothing
[93:23] happened i know a lot of people have got
[93:25] it
[93:28] i know zero people who died that i mean
[93:30] about no yeah a lot of people got it
[93:34] yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not what we feared
[93:36] we feared something much worse yeah
[93:38] that&#39;s correct so the adjustment&#39;s
[93:40] difficult to make so you said
[93:41] first of all we need real data we need
[93:44] just just parse out the data don&#39;t don&#39;t
[93:46] lump it all together no and then if if
[93:48] you give if you get people
[93:50] just
[93:51] parse out the data better
[93:53] clear clearer information
[93:55] um
[93:56] about uh like i said was this an actual
[93:59] code of a diagnosis or was it a or did
[94:02] they get the test and the test came back
[94:03] positive or do they just have some
[94:04] symptoms just parse those two out um and
[94:08] then
[94:08] parse out just uh if somebody died did
[94:11] they die
[94:12] did they did they even have a covet test
[94:15] or or did they just have one of many
[94:17] symptoms like like like how do you die
[94:19] without weakness i don&#39;t know right it&#39;s
[94:21] impossible basically yeah it&#39;s a good
[94:23] point if you&#39;re gonna die you&#39;re gonna
[94:24] have shortness of breath weakness and
[94:26] you might cough a little
[94:28] um so so was it quantified what was it
[94:31] yeah that person did they actually have
[94:32] a covert test and and the tests come
[94:34] back positive and then um if if they
[94:36] died did they uh die where where covert
[94:39] was
[94:40] um it didn&#39;t have to be the main course
[94:42] but it was a significant contributor to
[94:44] their death or was it not a significant
[94:47] contributor to the death
[94:49] right it&#39;s not as simple as just because
[94:52] you had covet covet killed you
[94:55] definitely not right yeah yeah i mean
[94:58] people die all the time and they have
[94:59] like flu and yes you know other colds
[95:01] and well we don&#39;t say that they died of
[95:03] those flu and other colds well that&#39;s
[95:04] what&#39;s so weird absolutely it&#39;s so
[95:06] popular
[95:07] and i use that word in a weird way but
[95:09] it&#39;s so popular that we&#39;ve kind of
[95:11] forgotten people die pneumonia every day
[95:15] yeah people die of
[95:16] the flu didn&#39;t take a break oh kovitz
[95:19] got this i&#39;m gonna sit this one out i&#39;m
[95:21] gonna be on the bench i&#39;m gonna wait
[95:23] until kovitz done before i jump back
[95:25] into the game of killing people no the
[95:27] flu is still here killing people i mean
[95:29] ev every year in the world several
[95:30] hundred thousand people die directly of
[95:32] the flu yeah not not tangentially right
[95:36] not every 61 000 in this country last
[95:39] year yeah and we&#39;re only five percent of
[95:41] the world
[95:42] and then there&#39;s cigarettes so oh man
[95:44] cigarettes not cigarettes will really
[95:46] kill you that&#39;s a weird one right we&#39;re
[95:48] terrified of this disease that were
[95:50] projected it could potentially kill 100
[95:53] if not 200 000 americans this year with
[95:55] cigarettes kill 500 000 and you don&#39;t
[95:58] hear a peep out of any politician
[96:01] there&#39;s no one running for congress is
[96:03] trying to ban cigarettes there&#39;s no one
[96:05] running for senate that wants to put
[96:06] some education plan in place it&#39;s going
[96:08] to stop cigarettes in their tracks
[96:11] yeah i mean
[96:12] a long time like several years ago i
[96:15] mean along with 10 10 years ago i helped
[96:17] make a movie cold thank you for smoking
[96:19] oh i saw that yeah um
[96:24] it it
[96:26] yeah
[96:27] um
[96:31] yeah it&#39;s crazy uh
[96:34] smoking barbecuing alongside just bad
[96:36] news it&#39;s not not good you know you&#39;re
[96:39] turning your lungs into smoke smoked
[96:40] beef and not great
[96:42] um
[96:43] so
[96:44] um yeah
[96:46] tylenol by the way also kills a lot of
[96:48] people yeah what is the number for
[96:50] tylenol over here um i&#39;m not sure the
[96:52] exact number but i believe it
[96:54] until the opioid crisis i believe
[96:56] tylenol was the number one killer of all
[96:59] drugs
[97:00] um because wow basically it&#39;s uh
[97:03] if you have if you get drunk and take a
[97:05] lot of tylenol
[97:06] um acetaminophen essentially it causes
[97:09] liver failure
[97:11] so sevilla would like get
[97:13] get wasted and then like have a headache
[97:15] and then pop a tonic tylenol gardens
[97:18] whoa yeah curtains is a funny word yeah
[97:21] you know so but nobody&#39;s like you know
[97:24] raging against tylenol
[97:26] yeah
[97:27] it&#39;s weird except acceptable deaths are
[97:29] weird and that&#39;s the real the slippery
[97:31] slope about this uh people shaming
[97:33] people for wanting to go back to work
[97:36] you know other people are gonna die well
[97:37] if you drive do you drive oh well you
[97:40] should stop driving because people die
[97:42] from driving
[97:43] so you know you definitely should fill
[97:45] up all the swimming pools because like
[97:47] 50 people die every day in this country
[97:49] from swimming so let&#39;s not swim anymore
[97:52] yeah what is the
[97:53] really dangerous we need to chop down
[97:55] all the coconuts
[97:57] coconuts kill 150 people every year yes
[97:59] cut down all the coconut trees we need
[98:00] those people yes it&#39;s at a certain point
[98:03] in time it&#39;s like
[98:05] we
[98:06] yeah we&#39;re vulnerable and we&#39;re also
[98:09] we we&#39;re also we have a finite existence
[98:11] no matter what we do nobody lives
[98:13] forever
[98:14] right um
[98:15] i mean the the the i mean i think you
[98:17] want to look at say deaths as like the
[98:20] but for this
[98:22] uh disease whatever they would have
[98:23] lived x number of years yeah you know so
[98:26] um
[98:27] you know if somebody dies when they&#39;re
[98:29] they&#39;re they&#39;re 20 and could live till
[98:30] 80 they they lost 60 years
[98:32] but if somebody dies when they&#39;re 80 and
[98:34] they might live until 81 they last one
[98:36] year yes so it&#39;s it&#39;s like how many life
[98:39] years were lost
[98:40] uh is is a probably you know the right
[98:43] metric to
[98:44] use i don&#39;t uh read my own comments but
[98:46] i do read other people&#39;s comments and i
[98:47] was reading this one little twitter beef
[98:49] that was going on where someone was
[98:51] saying that kovid takes an average of 10
[98:54] years off people&#39;s lives and we should
[98:57] appreciate those 10 years and then
[98:59] someone else said that&#39;s not true
[99:01] i&#39;m sure it&#39;s not true yeah definitely
[99:02] it&#39;s the twitter
[99:03] but someone else said
[99:05] the average age of people who die from
[99:07] covid is older than the average age
[99:10] people die
[99:12] it&#39;s very let&#39;s say just say it&#39;s like
[99:14] it&#39;s it&#39;s about the same
[99:16] that&#39;s a beautiful way of looking at it
[99:18] i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s unfortunate it sucks
[99:21] but it sucks if grandpa dies of
[99:23] alzheimer&#39;s or emphysema or leukemia it
[99:27] sucks sure it sucks when someone you
[99:28] love dies yes
[99:31] but
[99:32] i i&#39;m
[99:33] i mean actually if if this uh i think a
[99:36] lesson to be taken here
[99:38] that i think is quite important is that
[99:40] if
[99:41] um
[99:42] if you have you know your great
[99:43] grandparents and their their age and
[99:45] grandparents really be careful with uh
[99:49] with with uh
[99:50] you know any kind of flu or cold or
[99:53] something that that wouldn&#39;t is not
[99:55] dangerous to
[99:57] kids or young adults but is dangerous
[99:59] too to help the elderly is um if
[100:01] basically if your kids got a runny nose
[100:04] they should stay away from their
[100:05] grandparents
[100:08] no matter what it is it&#39;s it&#39;s uh the
[100:10] things that are
[100:11] where a young immune system is has no
[100:14] problem and an older one has has a
[100:16] problem yeah and
[100:17] um in fact a lot of the a lot of the
[100:19] deaths are just are literally it&#39;s
[100:20] tragic but they&#39;re they&#39;re intra family
[100:23] um it&#39;s the the the
[100:26] little little kid had it had a you know
[100:29] called or flew and give it to grandpa
[100:31] yeah yeah they have the family gathering
[100:33] and they don&#39;t know that this is a big
[100:36] deal but it&#39;s
[100:37] it&#39;s just important to remember when you
[100:38] get older your immune system is just not
[100:40] that strong and uh
[100:42] and and so just be be careful with your
[100:44] with with your you know
[100:46] loved ones or elderly and i think there
[100:48] is some
[100:50] true objective
[100:52] um understanding of the immune system
[100:55] and the ways to boost that immune system
[100:57] and i really think that that
[101:00] that information should be
[101:02] that should be distributed in a way a
[101:04] non-judgmental way but like look this is
[101:07] this is a way that we can all like this
[101:09] is a scientifically proven way that we
[101:11] can boost our immune system and it might
[101:12] save your life and it might save the
[101:14] life of your loved ones and maybe we
[101:15] could teach this to our grandparents and
[101:18] our parents and and people that are
[101:19] vulnerable you know vitamin c heat shock
[101:23] proteins all these different variables
[101:25] that we know contribute to a stronger
[101:27] immune system
[101:30] yeah um actually just um
[101:33] a thing that that is is is tough uh
[101:37] if
[101:38] like when you as you get older it&#39;s it&#39;s
[101:41] hard to
[101:42] be
[101:43] you pretend to put on weight
[101:44] you know i certainly that&#39;s happening
[101:46] with me you know like as the older i get
[101:47] i&#39;m like damn it&#39;s harder to stay lean
[101:50] uh that&#39;s for sure
[101:51] um
[101:52] and and so actually being being
[101:54] overweight is is a big deal yeah just uh
[101:57] it&#39;s a fact uh
[101:59] well
[102:00] yeah the new york hospital said it was
[102:02] the number one factor for severe uh
[102:04] kovid symptoms was obesity that was
[102:07] number one factor it is that that&#39;s yes
[102:10] exactly
[102:12] but it&#39;s also we live in a world where
[102:14] people want to be
[102:16] sensitive to other people&#39;s feelings so
[102:18] yeah absolutely we don&#39;t want to
[102:20] bring up the fact that
[102:22] being fat&#39;s bad for you it&#39;s a judgment
[102:24] on your food&#39;s great yeah i do love food
[102:28] yeah and i mean i mean to be totally
[102:29] frank i mean speaking for myself i&#39;d i&#39;d
[102:32] rather eat tasty food and live a shorter
[102:34] life
[102:35] yeah you know
[102:37] yeah those moments of enjoying a great
[102:40] meal yeah and then even talking about
[102:42] they&#39;re valuable they&#39;re worth something
[102:44] yeah it&#39;s not we don&#39;t want to eat
[102:45] soylent green and live to be 160.
[102:50] tasty if it was great one of the best
[102:52] things about life it really is yeah it&#39;s
[102:54] an art form as well it&#39;s like
[102:56] fine food
[102:58] it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
[103:00] it&#39;s
[103:01] a delicious sand castle it&#39;s temporary
[103:04] it doesn&#39;t last very long but there&#39;s
[103:06] something about it that&#39;s very pleasing
[103:08] yeah yeah um
[103:11] yeah i mean
[103:12] i i don&#39;t know what what advice to give
[103:14] like um maybe smaller have tasty food
[103:17] with smaller amounts of it
[103:20] yeah and
[103:21] i think
[103:22] regulated feeding windows really the way
[103:24] to go some sort of an intermittent
[103:25] fasting approach sure when i started
[103:28] doing that i i
[103:29] i i found myself to be quite a bit
[103:31] healthier when i&#39;ve deviated from that
[103:33] i&#39;ve gained weight so how what&#39;s what&#39;s
[103:35] uh 16 hours well 16 hours yeah
[103:38] so like at night or yeah yeah yeah so i
[103:41] get to a certain point and then i count
[103:43] out i usually uh hit the stopwatch on my
[103:46] phone and then i look at uh 15 hours and
[103:50] i&#39;m like okay got an hour before i can
[103:51] eat yeah and so
[103:53] anything in between that is just water
[103:55] or coffee
[103:56] actually you know like um
[103:58] this may be a useful bit of advice for
[104:00] for people but uh eating before you go
[104:02] to bed is a real bad idea and actually
[104:05] negatively affects your sleep yeah um
[104:07] and it can actually cause uh it
[104:09] heartburn that you don&#39;t even know is
[104:10] happening and and that subtle heartburn
[104:13] uh affects your sleep because you&#39;re
[104:15] you&#39;re horizontal and your body&#39;s
[104:17] digesting
[104:19] so if you want to improve the quality of
[104:20] your sleep um and and um
[104:23] you know uh you know
[104:25] be healthier uh it&#39;s it&#39;s do not eat
[104:28] right before we go to sleep yeah it&#39;s
[104:29] like one of the worst things you could
[104:30] do i had some of the biggest mistakes
[104:32] i&#39;ve ever met i&#39;ve i&#39;ve done that uh
[104:34] particularly after comedy shows i&#39;m
[104:35] starving i&#39;ll come home and i&#39;ll eat and
[104:38] then i go to bed and i just feel like
[104:40] [ __ ] and i wake up in the middle of the
[104:41] night it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna crush your
[104:43] sleep and it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna damage
[104:45] your
[104:46] uh pilot your pyloric sphincter and your
[104:48] esophagus and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so
[104:50] in fact
[104:51] drinking and then going to sleep is
[104:53] that&#39;s one of the worst things you could
[104:54] yes um
[104:56] so
[104:57] uh just
[104:59] try to avoid drinking and and
[105:05] you know
[105:06] um
[105:08] small amounts of alcohol that
[105:10] evidence suggests it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t
[105:12] have a
[105:14] negative effect i put in the same
[105:15] category as delicious food it kind of
[105:17] makes things a little more fun
[105:19] yeah yeah i like it i mean some of the
[105:21] people some of the people who have left
[105:22] the longest you know um there&#39;s a woman
[105:24] in france who i think
[105:26] maybe has the record or close to it and
[105:28] she had a glass of wine every day every
[105:30] day you know yeah
[105:31] small small amounts is fine um
[105:34] but um
[105:36] yeah this is like a i i learned this
[105:38] like quite late in life it&#39;s like just
[105:39] avoid having alcohol and avoid eating
[105:43] at least two or three hours before going
[105:44] to sleep and your quality of life will
[105:46] your quality of sleep will improve and
[105:48] your general health will improve a lot
[105:51] for sure this is a it&#39;s a big deal and i
[105:53] think not widely not widely known do you
[105:55] have time to
[105:56] exercise um
[105:58] a little bit
[106:00] um do you train or anything
[106:02] um i do although i haven&#39;t seen
[106:05] for a while but
[106:07] um
[106:08] yeah especially yeah from out like uh
[106:12] you know say we&#39;re working on starship
[106:14] or something in south texas and i&#39;m just
[106:16] living in my i got a little
[106:18] little house there in bukuchika village

[106:31] like i don&#39;t some people love running i
[106:33] don&#39;t love running
[106:34] um but what do you like to do exercise
[106:36] wise
[106:37] um
[106:39] too totally frank i wouldn&#39;t exercise at
[106:41] all if i could but if if i
[106:44] i&#39;d prefer not to exercise but if i&#39;m
[106:46] going to exercise and you know lift some
[106:47] weights and
[106:49] um
[106:50] and then
[106:51] kind of run on the treadmill and maybe
[106:53] watch a show that you know if there&#39;s a
[106:55] compelling show that like pulls you in
[106:57] right right right yeah that&#39;s a good
[106:59] thing to do yeah watch a good movie or
[107:01] yeah yeah episode of black mirror or
[107:03] something like that that&#39;s great man
[107:04] don&#39;t watch black mirror before going to
[107:06] bed either well don&#39;t watch black mirror
[107:07] today
[107:08] it&#39;s too [ __ ] accurate yeah exactly
[107:10] it&#39;s like wait this already happened in
[107:12] real life
[107:13] yeah they&#39;re too close it&#39;s too close

[107:27] reality he&#39;s nailed it is black mirror
[107:29] oh man it&#39;s like he&#39;s gonna have to like
[107:31] re reassess
[107:33] and and attack it from a different angle
[107:35] yeah
[107:36] you should try something that&#39;s fun to
[107:38] do that&#39;s not just like
[107:41] like learn a martial art or something

[108:21] strangling each other sure but they&#39;re
[108:22] some of the smartest people i know or
[108:24] jiu jitsu fiends because they they get
[108:27] they first of all they get introduced to
[108:29] it because usually either they want to
[108:31] exercise or learn some self-defense but
[108:33] then they realize that it&#39;s essentially
[108:35] like a language
[108:37] with your body like you&#39;re having an
[108:39] argument with someone with some sort of
[108:41] a physical language
[108:43] and it&#39;s really complex and the more
[108:45] access to vocabulary and the sharper
[108:48] your words are sure the the more you&#39;ll
[108:51] succeed in these ventures that&#39;s really
[108:54] also an accurate analogy of what jiu
[108:56] jitsu is yeah i mean i kind of i mean
[108:59] probably like a lot of people uh for the
[109:01] the way uh early day uh the first mma
[109:04] fights and joyce gracie and he was like
[109:06] incredible and it was like just like
[109:08] technique yeah yeah it was like you know
[109:11] winning against people way bigger and
[109:13] that kind of thing it&#39;s just like oh
[109:14] this is cool it was what martial arts
[109:16] were supposed to be when we were as we
[109:17] were kids yeah when you saw bruce lee
[109:19] [ __ ] up all these big giant guys like
[109:21] wow martial arts allow you to beat
[109:24] someone far bigger and stronger than you
[109:25] right
[109:27] most of the time that&#39;s not real
[109:29] especially if they know martial arts too
[109:32] it&#39;s like oh no yes but in the ufc when
[109:35] hoist gracie
[109:36] off of his back was strangling dan
[109:39] severin with his legs he was like holy
[109:41] [ __ ] yeah this guy&#39;s being pinned by
[109:43] this big giant wrestler and he wraps his
[109:46] legs around his neck and chokes him to
[109:48] the point the guy has to surrender yeah
[109:49] amazing yeah it was amazing
[109:52] i mean horse got beaten up pretty bad in
[109:54] some of those he did well he definitely
[109:56] had some rough fights but he won he won
[109:58] yeah
[109:59] he&#39;s a legend and but what it showed in
[110:02] i mean i&#39;m a huge lover of jiu jitsu
[110:04] what it showed is that there is a method
[110:07] for uh
[110:08] for
[110:09] diffusing these situations with
[110:11] technique and and knowledge yeah and i
[110:14] think it&#39;s also a great way to exercise
[110:16] too because it&#39;s almost like the
[110:17] exercise is secondary to the learning of
[110:20] the thing the the exercises like you
[110:22] want like and you want to develop
[110:24] strength and conditioning just so that
[110:25] you could be better at doing the thing
[110:27] and the analogy that i use is like if
[110:29] you imagine if you had a race car
[110:31] and you could actually give the race car
[110:34] better handling and more horsepower just
[110:36] from your own focus and effort sure
[110:38] that&#39;s really what it&#39;s like yeah
[110:40] totally yeah
[110:42] when am i going to have my my kids i
[110:44] should say i sent my kids to
[110:46] uh jiu jitsu uh since they were like i
[110:48] don&#39;t know six oh really yeah oh that&#39;s
[110:51] awesome yeah
[110:53] it&#39;s it&#39;s a great thing to learn it
[110:54] really is seems like a good yes yeah
[110:57] maybe something like i mean even if you
[110:59] just have someone who hits that holds
[111:00] the pads for you like you get a workout
[111:02] in and to be fun
[111:05] um when am i going to be able to buy one
[111:06] of them roadsters when&#39;s that happening
[111:09] well i can&#39;t you know
[111:12] say exactly when but uh
[111:16] we got to get
[111:17] you know
[111:18] those this cover thing&#39;s kind of
[111:20] throwing us for a loop i&#39;m sure um so
[111:24] um
[111:25] not to blame everything in the code but
[111:28] um
[111:29] it&#39;s you know
[111:30] certainly set us back on on progress for
[111:33] you know some number of months um
[111:36] the i mean things we&#39;ve got to get get
[111:38] done
[111:39] uh ahead of roadster are um
[111:42] you know ramping up model y production
[111:44] um that&#39;ll be a great great car it is a
[111:47] great car
[111:49] getting the
[111:50] berlin gigafactory built
[111:54] and and
[111:55] also building y
[111:56] getting expanding the shanghai factory
[111:58] which is going great
[112:01] and um
[112:03] get the you know there&#39;s a cyber truck
[112:05] semi truck roadster
[112:08] um
[112:09] roaster is kind of like dessert
[112:11] so
[112:12] like we we gotta get the
[112:14] you know eating potatoes and greens and
[112:16] stuff
[112:17] you know like
[112:18] but roaster comes before cyber truck
[112:24] i mean i think we should do cyber truck
[112:26] first before before road before started
[112:29] interesting
[112:30] i&#39;m not mad at that some other things
[112:32] for roadster uh they&#39;re they&#39;re you know
[112:34] the tri-motor
[112:36] uh plaid powertrain we&#39;re gonna have
[112:38] that in model s
[112:40] uh so that&#39;s like part one of the
[112:42] ingredients that&#39;s needed for for
[112:43] roadsters the the plaid powertrain the
[112:46] more advanced bat you know battery
[112:47] vacuum kind of thing i wanted to ask you
[112:48] about this before i forgot what there&#39;s
[112:50] a company that&#39;s called apex is taking
[112:52] your teslas and
[112:54] they&#39;re
[112:54] giving it a wider base and
[112:57] wider tires and a little bit more
[112:59] advanced suspension
[113:01] sure how do you feel about that are you
[113:02] guys do you work with them are you cool
[113:04] with those people yeah i mean just i&#39;m
[113:06] off yeah go ahead they&#39;re
[113:09] jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and
[113:11] doing a bunch of interior choices
[113:13] you&#39;re cool with you can&#39;t [ __ ] with
[113:15] that you don&#39;t have time so is it good
[113:17] that someone comes along and has a sort
[113:18] of specialty operation yeah i got no
[113:20] problem that&#39;s what it&#39;s called right
[113:21] it&#39;s like jmg is it called apex yeah i
[113:24] gotta unplug performance as apex that&#39;s
[113:26] right unplug performance yeah yeah you
[113:28] could for sure um
[113:31] you know lighten the car up and uh
[113:33] improve to tire traction and have you
[113:35] seen that company&#39;s stuff what they do i
[113:37] don&#39;t know specifically but there&#39;s it&#39;s
[113:39] pretty dope yeah they make a pretty dope
[113:41] looking they take model s and they they
[113:43] widen it and give it a bunch of carbon
[113:45] fiber that&#39;s it right there
[113:47] that looks pretty nice yeah it does
[113:50] now the the plaid
[113:52] version of the model s you are you going
[113:55] to widen the track and doing a bunch
[113:57] do a bunch of different i know you guys
[113:58] are testing at the nurburgring can you
[114:00] not talk about that well i think we got
[114:02] to leave that for
[114:04] you know proper sort of product unveil i
[114:06] understand yeah i understand um last
[114:08] time you were here you convinced me to
[114:10] buy a tesla i bought it and it&#39;s [ __ ]
[114:13] insane oh great glad you like it um
[114:15] i don&#39;t it&#39;s not just pretty fun it&#39;s
[114:17] like i the way i&#39;ve described it is it
[114:19] makes other cars seem stupid
[114:21] they just seem dumb like i love dumb
[114:23] things i love dumb cars like i love
[114:25] campfires yeah i love campfires i have a
[114:29] 1993 porsche that&#39;s air-cooled sure it&#39;s
[114:32] like re it&#39;s not that fast it&#39;s really
[114:34] slow compared to the tesla yeah really
[114:36] so it&#39;s really quite slow yeah but
[114:38] there&#39;s something
[114:39] engaging about the mechanical
[114:42] this is like the the gears and it&#39;s very
[114:45] it&#39;s very analog but it&#39;s so stupid in
[114:48] comparison to the tesla like when i want
[114:49] to go somewhere in the model s i hit the
[114:51] gas and just goes
[114:53] yeah it just it like violates time
[114:57] yeah yeah um
[114:59] yeah you&#39;ve tried it like ludicrous plus
[115:01] and stuff yeah yeah cool
[115:03] oh yeah we did just did a software
[115:05] update where it&#39;ll do it like a cheetah
[115:07] stance so uh yeah so it&#39;s it because
[115:10] it&#39;s got a
[115:11] dynamic air suspension so it lowers the
[115:12] back oh jesus
[115:14] yeah just like uh like a sprinter
[115:16] basically right like what do you do if
[115:17] you&#39;re a sprinter you&#39;re going to hunker
[115:18] down and then
[115:20] uh so
[115:21] i shaved like a 10th of a second off
[115:23] zero six i mean like you know
[115:25] it is pretty fun it&#39;s so i&#39;ve taken so
[115:28] many people and i&#39;m like i take them for
[115:30] the holy [ __ ] moment i&#39;m like you ready
[115:32] like hang on there and then a stomp on
[115:33] the gas i&#39;ve never felt anything like it
[115:35] it&#39;s confusing
[115:37] yeah it really is
[115:38] the the instant torque the instant
[115:40] torque and just the sheer acceleration
[115:43] is baffling it&#39;s baffling it&#39;s baffling
[115:45] they&#39;ve never felt it no it&#39;s faster
[115:47] than falling it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s so fast
[115:49] it&#39;s a roller coaster yeah and my family
[115:52] yells at me when i stomp the gas like um
[115:54] i tell my kids i&#39;m like you want to feel
[115:55] it you want to feel it like do it do it
[115:57] do it my wife&#39;s like don&#39;t do it
[116:01] yeah and even if i just do it on the
[116:02] highway for a couple of seconds that&#39;s
[116:04] pretty exciting yeah it&#39;s very it&#39;s like
[116:05] having a roller coaster on tap you know
[116:07] it really is like a roller coaster on
[116:09] top yeah without the loopty loops but
[116:11] it&#39;s the the pinning to your seat it
[116:13] seems like you&#39;re not supposed to be
[116:15] able to experience that from some sort
[116:16] of a can you know a consumer vehicle
[116:18] that you can just a regular person could
[116:21] buy if you have the money
[116:22] it seems too too crazy
[116:25] and then the idea of this roadster is a
[116:28] half of a second faster than that
[116:30] yeah that&#39;s madness
[116:33] well if that roads with a roadster we&#39;re
[116:34] going to do some things that are kind of
[116:35] unfair
[116:36] so
[116:38] we&#39;re going to take some things from
[116:39] like
[116:40] you know from uh kind of like rock
[116:42] rocket world and put them on the car so
[116:44] oh i read about that explain that like
[116:46] what do you do well like i said we can&#39;t
[116:48] oh the product unveiled right here but
[116:50] but
[116:51] it&#39;s gonna do some things that aren&#39;t
[116:52] fair
[116:53] and then
[116:54] the the when we do the unveil of the
[116:57] roadster
[116:58] let me just say that anyone who&#39;s been
[117:00] waiting they won&#39;t be sorry
[117:03] it&#39;s they won&#39;t be sorry oh i&#39;m sure
[117:05] well anything that goes zero to sixty
[117:07] what is it one point nine is that the
[117:08] zero 0-60 that&#39;s the base model that&#39;s
[117:10] good
[117:12] what&#39;s the top of the food chain model
[117:14] okay okay
[117:16] faster than that let&#39;s just say faster
[117:18] yeah that seems so crazy to me now what
[117:20] was it like when the dude threw the
[117:23] steel balls at the window and they were
[117:26] supposed to not break and it broke
[117:29] well
[117:30] yeah i mean i know
[117:32] any circumstances
[117:33] are you know you know that our demos are
[117:35] authentic
[117:36] [Laughter]
[117:37] so i was not expecting that and i and
[117:39] then i think i muttered under my breath
[117:43] you didn&#39;t get mad though
[117:45] no you didn&#39;t steve jobs it
[117:48] um
[117:49] no i i i definitely swore uh but you
[117:52] know i didn&#39;t think the mic would pick
[117:54] it up but it did um
[117:56] and uh
[117:57] but so
[117:59] like we practiced this
[118:01] you know behind the scenes yeah i would
[118:03] like it tesla we don&#39;t do we don&#39;t do
[118:05] like tons of practice for for our demos
[118:08] because we we work we&#39;re working on the
[118:10] cars like we you know we&#39;re building
[118:13] new technologies and and improving the
[118:15] the fundamental products so we&#39;re not
[118:17] spending it like doing like hundreds of
[118:19] you know practice things or anything
[118:21] like that we don&#39;t have time for that um
[118:23] but the the
[118:25] just hours before the demo um both franz
[118:28] uh you know uh is a head of design and
[118:31] and i were in the studio throwing steel
[118:33] balls at the window and it&#39;s bouncing
[118:35] right off
[118:36] um and like okay this seems pretty good
[118:38] seems like we got it okay
[118:40] um
[118:41] and then we think what happened was that
[118:44] um
[118:45] when we
[118:46] when when franz hit the the
[118:48] the door with the sledgehammer
[118:50] you know sure like like this is this is
[118:52] like yeah yeah yeah exoskeleton
[118:55] you know high strength hardened steel
[118:56] you can literally
[118:58] take wind up with a sledgehammer you
[119:00] know full
[119:01] double-handed sledgehammer
[119:04] and hit the door and there&#39;s not even a
[119:05] dent it&#39;s cool
[119:08] but we think that that cracked the
[119:10] corner of the glass
[119:12] at the bottom
[119:14] and then
[119:15] once you crack the corner of the glass
[119:17] that you just came over
[119:18] so
[119:19] uh
[119:21] then when you threw the bowl that that&#39;s
[119:23] what cracked the glass so it didn&#39;t go
[119:24] through though it didn&#39;t go through
[119:26] that&#39;s true that&#39;s true it didn&#39;t
[119:27] shatter the whole thing like a regular
[119:28] window would either which would just
[119:30] dissolve yeah right
[119:31] so in hindsight the ball should have
[119:33] been first sledgehammer second yeah
[119:36] yeah you live you learn yeah exactly
[119:39] listen man uh we&#39;ve taken up a lot of
[119:41] your time you had a child yeah recently
[119:43] it&#39;s amazing that you had the time to
[119:44] come down here and i really appreciate
[119:46] that i appreciate everything you do man
[119:48] i i&#39;m i&#39;m glad you&#39;re out there and uh i
[119:51] really appreciate you coming down here
[119:52] and sharing your perspective well i
